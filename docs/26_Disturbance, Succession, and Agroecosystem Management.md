## 18. Disturbance, Succession, and Agroecosystem Management

The ecological concepts of disturbance and recovery through
succession have important application in agroecology.
Agroecosystems are constantly undergoing disturbance in
the form of cultivation, soil preparation, sowing, planting,
irrigation, fertilizer application, pest management, pruning, harvesting, and burning. When disturbance is frequent,
widespread, and intense—as it is in industrial agriculture—
agroecosystems are limited to the earliest stages of succession. This condition enables high productivity but requires
large inputs of fertilizer and pesticides, and tends to degrade
the soil resource over time.


More sustainable food production can be achieved by
moving away from dependency on continual and excessive
disturbance and allowing successional processes to progress
further and generate greater ecological complexity. Based on
our understanding of disturbance and succession in natural
ecosystems, we can enhance the ability of agroecosystems to
maintain both fertility and productivity through appropriate
management of disturbance and recovery.


**DISTURBANCE AND RECOVERY**

**IN NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS**


A long-standing tenet of ecology is that following a disturbance, an ecosystem immediately begins a process of recovery from that disturbance. Recovery takes place through the
relatively orderly process of succession, which was introduced in Chapter 2. In the broadest sense, ecological succession is the process of ecosystem development, whereby
distinct changes in community structure and function occur
over time.


Ecologists distinguish two basic types of succession.
**Primary succession** is ecosystem development on sites (such
as bare rock, glaciated surfaces, or recently formed volcanic
islands) that were not previously occupied by living organisms or subject to the changes that the biotic components can
bring to bear on the abiotic components. **Secondary succes-**
**sion** is ecosystem development on sites that were previously
occupied by living organisms, but had some or all of those
organisms removed by fire, flooding, severe wind, intense
grazing, or some other event. Depending on the intensity, frequency, and duration of the disturbance, the impact on the
structure and function of the ecosystem will vary, as will
the time required for recovery from the disturbance. Since
the disturbance and recovery process that occur in agriculture
usually take place in sites that formerly had other biotic components, we will focus our attention here on the secondary
succession process.



**T** **he** **N** **ature** **of** **D** **isturbance**


Although natural ecosystems give the impression of being
stable and unchanging, they are constantly being altered
on some scale by events such as fire, wind storms, floods,
extremes of temperature, epidemic outbreaks, falling trees,
mudslides, and erosion. These events disturb ecosystems by
killing organisms, destroying and modifying habitats, and
changing abiotic conditions. Any of these impacts can change
the structure of a natural ecosystem and cause changes in the
population levels of the organisms present and the biomass
they store.

Disturbance can vary in three dimensions:


1. _Intensity of disturbance_ can be measured by the

amount of biomass removed or the number of individuals killed. The three types of fire described
in Chapter 10 provide good examples of variation
in disturbance intensity: surface fires usually create low-intensity disturbance, whereas crown fires
cause high-intensity disturbance.
2. _Frequency of disturbance_ is the average amount of

time between each disturbance event. The longer
the time span between disturbances, the greater the
ability of the ecosystem to fully recover after each
disturbance.

3. _Scale of disturbance_ is the spatial scope of the dis
turbance, which can vary from a small, localized
patch to the entire landscape. The small gap in the
forest canopy created by an individual tree falling
is a small-scale disturbance, whereas the massive
destruction of a powerful hurricane is very large
scale.


All three characteristics of disturbance are often intertwined

in complex ways. Fire, for example, may occur with varying frequency; it may be distributed over the landscape in a
patchy manner; and where it does occur it may burn some
areas very intensely and others hardly at all.


**R** **ecovery** **P** **rocess**


Any change or alteration of the ecosystem by a disturbance
is followed by a recovery process. Recovery occurs through
the combined action of several ecosystem dynamics: (1) the
biotic community as a whole modifies the physical environment through the many forms of interference described in
previous chapters; (2) competition and coexistence between

a Although some changes are presented in stepwise form, all occur as gradual transitions.



individual organisms and populations cause changes in the
diversity and abundance of species; and (3) energy flow shifts
from production to respiration as more and more energy
in the system is needed to support the growing amount of
standing biomass. The interaction of these processes directs
a recovering ecosystem through a number of stages of development (originally called seral stages) that eventually lead to
a structure and level of ecosystem complexity similar to what
existed before the disturbance occurred.


During the recovery process, many important changes in
ecosystem structure and function occur. These are most distinct following a relatively severe and extensive disturbance.
A summary of some of the more important characteristics of
the successional process that follows a major disturbance is
presented in Table 18.1. The early or pioneer stages of succession are dominated by _r_ -selected, easily dispersed weedy
species, but as these early invaders either alter the conditions of the environment or are displaced by interference
from later arrivals, _K_ -selected species begin to dominate.
The replacement of earlier species of plants and animals by
others over time has been commonly observed during the
recovery process (e.g., Bazzaz 1996; Finegan 1996; Walker
et al. 2007).

Most of the components of ecological diversity (described
in the previous chapter) increase during succession, especially
in the early stages, often reaching their highest levels prior
to full recovery. Of particular agroecological importance is



the fact that gross photosynthesis during the early stages of
succession normally greatly exceeds total respiration, resulting in high net primary productivity (NPP) and high harvest
potential. As the standing crop increases with successional
development, however, a greater proportion of productivity
is used for maintenance, creating the impression of greater
stability.

Another aspect of successional development that has
important agroecological implications is the increase in
biomass and the standing crop of organic matter with time,
especially in the early stages of succession. Since biomass
is eventually converted to detritus and humus as it passes
through the decomposers, this increase in biomass results
indirectly in an increase in soil organic matter.

During the early stages of recovery, nutrient availability
is usually high and nutrient conservation relatively inefficient. Fast-growing, ruderal plant species quickly become
dominant, and population interaction is limited to the few
species present. As succession progresses, nutrient retention
improves, colonizing species begin to occupy a greater diversity of niches in the system, population interaction intensifies
(especially interactions that involve resource partitioning and
mutualistic interference), and the structure of the ecosystem
becomes more complex and interconnected.

If enough time is allowed to pass after a disturbance,
an ecosystem eventually reaches a point (formerly referred
to as the climax stage) at which most of the characteristics


Disturbance, Succession, and Agroecosystem Management **223**



presented in Table 18.1 cease to change significantly in rate
or character. In terms of species diversity, for example, new
colonizing species equal the number of emigrating species
or those going extinct. Nutrient losses from the system are
balanced by inputs from outside. The population levels of
species fluctuate seasonally, but do so around a fairly constant mean number. At this stage, the system is once again
in a tenuous equilibrium with the regional climate and local
conditions of soil, topography, and moisture availability.
Change still occurs, but it is no longer directional, developmental change, but change oriented around an equilibrium
point. In Chapter 2, we described such a condition as one of
_dynamic equilibrium_, a concept that takes into account the
fact that all environments are constantly changing and evolving, with new disturbances occurring frequently on at least
a small scale.


In the typical mature ecosystem, then, localized sites may
be undergoing disturbance on a regular basis, but the characteristics listed in Table 18.1 are developed sufficiently enough
for energy and nutrient utilization to be highly efficient, food
webs complex, and mutualistic relationships prevalent. The
system is able to resist change and to be resilient when disturbance occurs. Thus, the disturbance events that do occur
do not result in drastic change, but neither do they allow a
steady-state condition.


**I** **ntermediate** **D** **isturbance**


In some ecosystems, the frequency, intensity, and scale of
disturbance are such that the system never reaches full maturity, but is nevertheless able to maintain the species diversity, resilience, and energy use efficiency characteristic of
a mature ecosystem. Where hurricanes occur, for example,
these high-intensity disturbance events—as long as they are
low in frequency—tend to generate forest systems with both
high species diversity and high biomass (Vandermeer et al.
2000; Mascaro et al. 2005). Ecologists studying these systems have posited the **intermediate disturbance hypothesis**,
which states that in natural ecosystems where environmental disturbances are neither too frequent nor too seldom (at
some intermediate frequency) both diversity and productivity
can be high (Connell and Slayter 1977; Connell 1978). The
disturbance in these systems retains the early successional
characteristic of high productivity, while the system’s overall
stability allows the high species diversity more characteristic
of mature ecosystems.

Some natural ecosystems for which the intermediate disturbance hypothesis may apply are presented in Table 18.2.
An examination of these systems reveals that intermediate
disturbance can come about through a great variety of different combinations of disturbance frequency, disturbance
intensity, and disturbance scale. At an ecosystem level, relatively intense and frequent disturbance on a small scale, for
example, can have an effect similar to that of low-intensity,
low-frequency disturbance on a larger scale.

In many intermediate disturbance situations, disturbance
distributed irregularly over the landscape in time and space

creates what is known as a **patchy landscape**, in which
numerous stages of succession occur in a relatively small
area. The variation in developmental stage from patch to
patch contributes to the maintenance of considerable diversity at the ecosystem level. Successional **patchiness** can
therefore be seen as an important aspect of the ecological
dynamics of ecosystems. Patch size, variation in patch development, and the nature of the interfaces between patches all
become important variables, and ecologists have invested
considerable study attempting to understand their role in
natural ecosystems (Pickett and White 1985; Groom et al.
2006). The inherent patchiness of many agricultural landscapes points out the potential application of intermediate
disturbance and patchiness to agroecosystem management
(Bruun 2000). As we will see in more detail in Chapter 21,
the concept of patchiness has become especially important in
approaches that seek to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem
services in agricultural landscapes (Swift et al. 2004; Groom
et al. 2006).


**APPLICATIONS TO AGROECOSYSTEM**

**MANAGEMENT**


Modern agriculture has developed practices, technologies,
and inputs that allow farmers to ignore most successional
processes. In place of natural recovery, farmers use inputs
and materials that replace what is removed at harvest or
altered with cultivation. Constant disturbance keeps the
agroecosystem at the early stages of succession, where a
greater proportion of gross productivity is available as net
productivity or harvestable biomass. But in order to develop
more resilient systems that are much less dependent on
human interventions and polluting, nonrenewable inputs,
we must do much more to take advantage of natural ecosystem recovery processes. Our knowledge of the successional process in natural ecosystems can be used both to
aid agroecosystems in their recovery from the impacts of
human-induced disturbance and to introduce disturbances

in a planned manner.

Simply stated, the task is to design agroecosystems that
on the one hand take advantage of some of the beneficial
attributes of the early stages of succession, yet on the other
hand incorporate some of the advantages gained by allowing
the system to reach the later stages of succession. As shown
in Table 18.3, only one desirable ecological characteristic
of agroecosystems—high NPP—occurs in the early stages
of successional development; all the others do not become
manifest until the later stages of development.

The challenge for research, then, is to develop ways of
integrating disturbance and development so as to take best
advantage of both extremes. This involves learning how to
use successional processes for installing and developing an
agroecosystem, as well as for reintroducing disturbance and
recovery at appropriate times in the life of the system.


**A** **llowing** **S** **uccessional** **D** **evelopment**


Agriculture has long taken advantage of disturbance to keep
farming systems in the earlier stages of succession. This is
especially true for annual cropping systems, where no part
of the ecosystem is allowed to progress beyond the early pioneer stage of development. In this stage, the system can produce large amounts of harvestable material, but keeping an
agroecosystem at this high output level takes its toll on other
developmental processes and thereby limits the advantages
they might otherwise provide.

Another approach to agroecosystem management is to
“mimic nature” by installing a farming system that uses as
a model the successional processes that go on naturally in
that location (Ewel 1999; Jackson 2011). Through such an



approach—sometimes called the “analog model” or “natural
systems agriculture”—we can establish agroecosystems that
are both resilient and productive.

Under a scheme of managed succession, natural successional stages are mimicked by intentionally introducing plants, animals, practices, and inputs that promote the
development of interactions and connections between component parts of the agroecosystem. Plant species (both crop
and noncrop) are planted that capture and retain nutrients
in the system and promote good soil development. These
plants include legumes, with their nitrogen-fixing bacteria,
and plants with phosphorus-trapping mycorrhizae. As the
system develops, increasing diversity, food web complexity,
and level of mutualistic interactions all lead to more effective

feedback mechanisms for pest and disease management. The
emphasis during the development process is on building a
complex and integrated agroecosystem.

Such a strategy may require more intensive human management, but because processes and interactions are internalized within the agroecosystem, it should lead to less
dependence on human-derived inputs from outside of the
system and greater stability.

There are many ways that a farmer, beginning with a
recently cultivated field of bare soil, can allow successional
development to proceed beyond the early stages. One general
model, beginning with an annual monoculture and progressing to a perennial tree crop system, is illustrated in Figure
18.3 and described in the following:


1–2. The farmer begins by planting a single annual crop

that grows rapidly, captures soil nutrients, gives
an early yield, and acts as a pioneer species in
the developmental process. The farmer could also
choose to introduce other less aggressive annuals
into the initial planting, mimicking the early successional process.
3. As a next step (or instead of the previous one), the

farmer can plant a polyculture of annuals that represent different components of the pioneer stage. The
species would differ in their nutrient needs, attract
different insects, have different rooting depths, and
return a different proportion of their biomass to the
soil. One might be a nitrogen-fixing legume. Small
livestock such as ducks or geese might be allowed
to graze on weeds or feed on snails that might be
common colonizers. All of these early species
would contribute to the initiation of the recovery
process, and they would modify the environment
so that noncrop plants and animals—especially
the macro- and microorganisms necessary for
developing the soil ecosystem—can also begin to
colonize.

4. Following the initial stage of development (toward

the end of the first season or at the beginning of the
second or third season), short-lived perennial crops
might begin to be introduced. Taking advantage of


Disturbance, Succession, and Agroecosystem Management **225**



**FIGURE 18.1** **The short-lived perennial yuca (** _**M. esculenta**_ **)**
**growing in an annual corn crop, Turrialba, Costa Rica.** The
yuca is introduced after the corn is established.


the soil cover created by the pioneer crops, these
species can diversify the agroecosystem in important ecological aspects. Deeper root systems, more
organic matter stored in standing biomass, and
greater habitat microclimate diversity all combine
to advance the successional development of the
agroecosystem (Figure 18.1).
5. Once soil conditions improve sufficiently, the

ground is prepared for planting longer-lived
perennials, especially orchard or tree crops, with
annual and short-lived perennial crops maintained in the areas between them. While the

trees are in their early growth, they have limited impact on the environment around them. At
the same time, they benefit from having annual
crops around them, because in the early stages of
growth they are often more susceptible to interference from the more aggressive weedy _r_ -selected
noncrop species that would otherwise occupy the
area (Figure 18.2).
6. As the tree crops develop, the space in between

them can continue to be managed with annuals
and short-lived perennials, using the agroforestry
approach described below. Larger livestock can
be introduced at this point for vegetation management, enterprise diversification, and better nutrient
cycling (see Chapter 19).
7. Eventually, once the trees reach full development,

the end point in the developmental process is
achieved. This end point could be modeled after the
structure of natural ecosystems of the region. Once
it has been achieved, the farmer has the choice of
maintaining it (possibly as an integrated system
with livestock) or introducing controlled disturbance in ways that return the agroecosystem, or
selected parts of it, to earlier stages of succession.

**cropped into a corn–squash planting in southern Campeche,**

system is called _taungya_ .


It is useful to examine how NPP and standing biomass change
over time when an agroecosystem is allowed to progress
through the stages described in Figure 18.3. These changes
will be similar to those that occur in a natural ecosystem as
it undergoes succession after disturbance; a general model
for these changes over time is presented in Figure 18.4. NPP
increases rapidly during the earliest stages of agroecosystem development, with most of that increase being available
as harvestable products. A time interval in the early stages
of successional development (e.g., Stages 2 and 3 in Figure
18.3) will show the most rapid increase in NPP available
during the developmental process, and provide the greatest
amount of harvestable material in the shortest time. This

could also be the point at which the most biomass is available for grazing animals. In the later stages of development
(e.g., Stage 7 in Figure 18.3), when the rate of NPP begins
to decrease, standing biomass (in the form of accumulated
perennial biomass) is relatively high, but the actual amount
of new harvestable material produced in each time interval
begins to drop.

The changing relationship between NPP and biomass over
time determines what management and production strategies
can be used at each stage of agroecosystem development. The
trade-offs and constraints change. In the early stages of development, for example, constant removal of NPP restricts the
accumulation of biomass, whereas restricted harvest of NPP
forces a farmer to wait several years for harvest. Grazing animals can help accelerate biomass turnover as long as their
manures are kept in the system. At the intermediate stages
of development, NPP is high enough for part of it to be harvested as fruit or nuts and part allowed to accumulate as biomass. By the later stages (e.g., Stage 7 in Figure 18.3), NPP
declines to a low enough level that a workable strategy is to
allow all new NPPs to accumulate as biomass, and to harvest
the biomass selectively for fuel, timber, forage, paper pulp,
or even food.

Once a successionally developed agroecosystem has been
created, the problem becomes one of how to manage it. The
farmer has three basic options:


1. Return the entire system to the initial stages of suc
cession by introducing a major disturbance, such
as clear-cutting the trees in the perennial system.



Many of the ecological advantages that have been
achieved will be lost and the process must begin

anew.

2. Maintain the system as a perennial or tree crop

agroecosystem, with or without livestock.
3. Reintroduce disturbance into the agroecosystem in

a controlled and localized manner, taking advantage
of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the
dynamics that such patchiness introduces into an

ecosystem. Small areas in the system can be cleared,
returning those areas to earlier stages in succession,
and allowing a return to the planting of annual or
short-lived crops. If care is taken in the disturbance
process, the belowground ecosystem can be kept at
a later stage of development, whereas the aboveground system can be made up of highly productive
species that are available for harvest removal. Such
a mixture of early and later stages of development
leads to the formation of a **successional mosaic** .

This mosaic can be adjusted and managed according to the ecological conditions of the area, as well
as the needs of the farmer and changes in market
conditions. It can also incorporate livestock.


The latter option provides the most advantages and offers
the greatest flexibility to the farmer. Within the constraints
imposed by the ecological limits of the cropping region, the
final mixture of annual and perennial plants and grazing
animals can be tailored to the needs of the farmer and farm
community and adjusted to fit market demand, the distance
to market, the ability to enter into the market, and the farmer’s ability to purchase and transport inputs. The closer the
farm is to inputs, labor, and markets, the heavier the emphasis can be on the annual component.

The biggest challenge in managing a successionally developed system is to learn how to introduce disturbance in ways
that stimulate system productivity on the one hand, and provide resistance to change and variation within the ecosystem on the other. This can be done in many different ways



depending on local environmental conditions, the structure
of mature natural ecosystems normally present, and the feasibility of maintaining modifications of those conditions over
the long term.

For example, in the prairie region of the United States,
where a large percentage of the country’s annual grain production currently takes place, the use of a successional model
for designing a treeless perennial grain system (discussed
in Chapter 14) might be the focus. Another example applies
to the rice-growing regions of the Yangtze River valley of
China, where the long-term maintenance of paddy systems is
based on knowledge of wetland ecosystems, periodic flooding, and human alteration of paddy soil. A successionally
developed paddy rice agroecosystem could incorporate a
perennial component by using trees that tolerate wet, flooded
conditions, such as willows, bald cypress, and other riparian
or wetland species, and by adding an animal component consisting of waterfowl and fish.


**AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS**


Although the perennial components of a successionally
developed agroecosystem do not have to be trees, systems
with trees provide some of the best examples of how successional development can be managed. The term **agroforestry**
has been given to practices that intentionally retain or plant
trees on land used for crop production or grazing (Wiersum
1981; Nair 1983). Such systems combine elements of crop
or animal agriculture with elements of forestry, either at the
same time or in sequence, building on the unique productive


**228** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



and protective value of trees. There are many variations
in practices that fall into the category of agroforestry: in
agrosilviculture, trees are combined with crops; in silvopastoral systems, trees are combined with animal production;
and in agrosilvopastoral systems, the farmer manages a complex mixture of trees, crops, and animals. All agroforestry
systems are good examples of taking advantage of diversity
and successional development for production of food and
other farm products.

Incorporating trees into agroecosystems is a practice with
a long history. This is especially true in the tropical and
subtropical regions of the world, where farmers have long
planted trees along with other agricultural crops and animals



to help provide for the basic needs of food, wood products,
and fodder, and to help conserve and protect their often limited resources (Nair 1983). Agroforestry systems in temperate regions of the world are also well known (Gordon and
Newman 1997).

The objective of most agroforestry systems is to optimize the beneficial effects of the interactions that occur
among the woody components and the crop or animal components in order to obtain more diversity of products, lessen
the need for outside inputs, and lower the negative environmental impacts of farming practices. In many respects,
agroforestry systems create the same ecological benefits as
multiple cropping systems, and the research methods used



**CASE STUDY: SLASH MULCH SYSTEM OF THE NEOTROPICS: MIMICKING RAINFOREST PROCESS**

In tropical soils, nutrients such as phosphorus are often “fixed” into unavailable forms through chemical reactions with
soil minerals or interaction with volcanic clay parent materials. In many humid tropical rainforests, therefore, most available nutrients are found in the plant biomass itself—both in the live standing biomass of plants and in the deep layer of
litter on the forest floor (Chapin et al. 1986). Tropical trees and other plants deal with this situation by sending their roots
into the decomposing plant litter, where they can take up nutrients before they are released into the soil, and by interacting with mycorrhizal and other fungi that break down the organic matter in the litter layer.

In high-rainfall parts of Latin America, farmers grow dry beans using a traditional (and likely pre-Hispanic) system
known as slash mulch, or _frijol tapado_, that mimics the nutrient cycling of the surrounding (or former) tropical rainforest
ecosystem. That is, the bean plants grow primarily in a layer of mulch rather than in the soil.

The production system starts by selecting a suitable section of second-growth vegetation and cutting pathways several
meters apart using machetes. Then bean seeds are thrown into the vegetation on either side of the path at a seeding density appropriate to the area and known through experience. Then the vegetation is cut down and spread to form an even
mulch layer that may be as deep as 20 cm. The beans then germinate, sending roots into the mulch layer and expanding
the hypocotyl (the stem between the root and the cotyledons) through the mulch. Each bean plant develops most of its
root system (75%–85% in the mulch layer, allowing the aboveground portion of flowers and fruits to produce the dried
seed that is harvested (Rosemeyer et al. 2000) (Figure 18.6).

**FIGURE 18.6** **A farmer cuts the second growth on top of the bean seeds, which have already been scattered into the**

Disturbance, Succession, and Agroecosystem Management **229**


Because the mulch layer inhibits the germination of weed seeds, but doesn’t affect the large and nutrient-rich beans,
the bean plants have little competition from weeds growing from seed. The thick mulch layer maintains a moist environment for the roots and prevents soil erosion. As small farmers are pushed up the hillsides into marginal lands by export
production, this latter feature of the system becomes especially important.

By ramifying their root systems through the litter or mulch layers, the bean plants have ready access to nutrients,
and they also avoid many soilborne pathogens. In experiments that took place in Costa Rica, bean plants grown in a
slash mulch system showed a lower incidence of Anthracnose root lesions ( _Colletotrichum lindemuthianum_ ), root-knot
nematode galls ( _Meloidogyne_ sp.), and Fusarium root rot than bean plants grown in soil, although it was also true that
hypocotyl infection with _Rhizoctonia_ increased. Nodulation by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizae was also higher
in the mulch-grown plants as compared with those grown in the soil without fertilization (Rosemeyer et al. 2000).
Additional preliminary experiments have shown that diversity of both nematodes and insects was greater in mulched
than in unmulched systems.

With increasing pressure on the land base, the fallow periods traditionally used with this system have tended to
decrease, reducing the amount of biomass that accumulates and can be made into mulch. This threatens the viability
of the system, but it has also prompted innovation. Experiments with alley cropping show that trees are able to provide
a sustainable mulch layer through annual pruning. The nitrogen-fixing, early succession agroforestry trees _Calliandra_
and _Inga_, with rapid and slow leaf decomposition respectively, can provide significantly greater mulch volume and subsequent bean yields than the traditional slash mulch system (Kettler 1996).

By maintaining the mulch layer and using the valuable organic matter produced as part of secondary growth, the
slash mulch system manages succession in a way that limits the disturbance of the soil. Fire is not used and bare soil is
not exposed. In other words, disturbance returns the system to an earlier stage of succession, but not completely to the
beginning. In this sense, the system is much more sustainable. Similar ways of limiting the intensity of disturbance might
be developed for other agroecosystems where periodic land clearing is a management tool.



to analyze multiple cropping systems apply equally well to
agroforestry systems.

Trees are capable of altering dramatically the conditions
of the ecosystem of which they are part (Reifsnyder and
Darnhofer 1989; Farrell 1990). The sustainable productivity
of agroforestry systems is due in large part to this capability
of trees (Figure 18.7).


**FIGURE 18.7** **Cows crowding into the shade of a lone** _**Ceiba**_
_**pentandra**_ **left in a tropical lowland pasture in Tabasco, Mexico.**
Trees can provide a number of benefits to pasture and grazing

systems.



Belowground, a tree’s roots penetrate deeper than those of
annual crops, affecting soil structure, nutrient cycling, and
soil moisture relations. Aboveground, a tree alters the light
environment by shading, which in turn affects humidity and
evapotranspiration. Its branches and leaves provide habitats
for an array of animal life and modify the local effects of
wind. Shed leaves provide soil cover and modify the soil
environment; as they decay they become an important source
of organic matter. These and other ecological effects of trees
are summarized in Figure 18.8.

Because of these effects, trees in agroecosystems are a
good foundation for developing the emergent qualities of
more complex ecosystems. They allow more efficient capture of solar energy; enhance nutrient uptake, retention, and
cycling; and maintain the system in dynamic equilibrium.
By providing permanent microsites and resources, they
make possible a more stable population of both pests and
their predators. In an agroforestry system, all of these factor
interactions can be managed to the benefit of the associated
crop plant and animals, while at the same time lessening the
dependence of the system on outside inputs.


**Design and Management of Agroforestry Systems**
In an agroforestry system, farmers have the choice of how
many trees to include, how frequently and in what patterns
to remove them, and what kind of pattern of successional
mosaic to maintain. These management decisions depend on
the local environment and culture, as well as the nature and
proximity of markets.

**FIGURE 18.8** **Effects of a tree on the surrounding agroecosystem.** Because of its size, root depth, and perennial nature, a tree has
significant effects on the abiotic conditions of an agroecosystem and takes part in many biotic interactions. In addition to the effects and
interactions shown, a tree can limit wind and water erosion, provide shade and browse for animals, form mycorrhizal associations, moderate soil temperature, and reduce evapotranspiration. Leguminous trees can contribute nitrogen to the system through their association
with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. (Adapted from Nair, P.K.R., _Soil Productivity Aspects of Agroforestry: Science and Practice in Agroforestry_,

New York, 1990, pp. 169–183.)


**CASE STUDY: EFFECT OF TREES ON SOIL IN TLAXCALA, MEXICO**
Trees affect the environment of an agroforestry system in a variety of ways. The specific effects vary from system to
system, depending on factors such as altitude, annual rainfall, wind patterns, geography, soil type, and, of course, the
species of tree. To effectively use trees in an agroecosystem, it is important to consider all of these factors, as well as the
farmer’s needs.

In the low-lying areas of Tlaxcala, Mexico, farmers typically maintain some combination of five different types of
trees, either scattered in their fields or arranged as borders. Researcher John Farrell chose to study the two trees that are
most commonly associated with agricultural fields in Tlaxcala, _Prunus capuli_ and _Juniperus deppeana_ (Farrell 1990).
For each species, he or she studied the conditions directly under the crown of the tree, in the shade zone of the tree, in the
zone affected by the tree root system, and in the zone outside of the direct influence of the tree.

Farrell found that soil conditions were consistently improved by the presence of the trees. Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of the soil was significantly higher in the zone of influence of the trees; other beneficial effects included a
higher soil pH, increased moisture content and lower soil temperature. All of these effects decreased with distance from
the tree.


On the negative side, harvest yields were reduced directly under the canopy of the tree; corn planted in this area was
shorter and produced approximately half as much grain as corn outside the zone. However, corn in the partially shaded
areas within the zone of root influence produced just as well as corn grown outside the influence of the tree. Farrell concluded that the lower yield of the shaded corn was due solely to shading and not to competition for nutrients.

The shading of crop plants under a tree’s canopy demonstrates that using trees in agroecosystems always involves
trade-offs. However, with proper management, farmers can maximize the substantial benefits of trees while minimizing
their negative impacts on harvest yield.



**Optimizing Positive Impacts of Trees**
Knowledge of both the positive and negative impacts of
trees on the rest of the agroecosystem is essential to fully
and effectively integrate trees into the system. The positive impacts discussed earlier need to be balanced with



the possible negative impacts of trees. These include competitive or allelopathic interference between trees and other
crops, microclimate modification that creates conditions
favoring disease or pest outbreak, and damage to crop quality caused by branches or fruits falling from mature trees.


Disturbance, Succession, and Agroecosystem Management **231**



These negative effects of trees can usually be avoided or
mitigated by appropriate spatial arrangement of the trees,
choice of tree species, choice of annual species, timing of
planting, and pruning. Integration of trees takes extensive
knowledge of the full range of ecological interactions that

can occur.


**Managing Interdependency**
As our knowledge of the ecological processes taking place
in complex agroforestry systems becomes more complete,
we can begin to see how the different components of such
systems become interdependent. An annual cropping component can become dependent on the trees for habitat modification, nutrient capture from deeper depths in the soil, and
harboring of beneficial insects. The presence of the cropping component in the system can displace invasive noncrop
plants that might interfere with the growth of the trees.
Animals benefit from the high NPP of the annual or shortlived crop or forage part of the system, and return nutrients
to the soil in the form of urine and manures (for further discussion of the role of animals in agroforestry systems, see
Chapter 19). Management of agroforestry systems should
focus on maximizing the benefits of these complex sets of
ecological interdependencies.

We must also remember that ecological interdependencies are only part of the picture. Humans are dependent on
trees in agroecosystems for such items as firewood, construction material, browse for animals, fruits and nuts, spice, and
medicinals. Agroforestry systems can be designed and managed with these needs in mind, so that the trees serve important roles both ecologically and economically. When this



occurs, an interdependency can develop between the farming
community and its farms.


**Spatial Arrangement of Trees**
Trees can be arranged in an agroforestry system in a variety of ways. The pattern used will depend on the needs of
the farmer, the nature of the agroecosystem, and the local
environmental and economic conditions. As an example,
Figure 18.9 shows six different ways that the same percentage of ground in an agroecosystem can be covered by trees.

If the primary emphasis of the farmer is on silvopastoral
activities, with trees intended to provide living fences, windbreaks, occasional forage from prunings, and harvestable
products such as firewood or fruit, then a boundary planting
of trees around areas of pasture (a) may be the best design. If,
in another case, wind is a problem, but the focus is on crop
production, a shelterbelt or windbreak system (b) may be best.
When the tree component is intended to provide mulch from
leaf fall or prunings to enhance crop production, shelterbelts
can be narrow tree rows between alleys used for agriculture
(c). When the trees also have agricultural value, they may be
dispersed among the cropping system or pasture, either uniformly (d) or more randomly (e). Finally, if soil conditions are
so poor that permanent cropping or grazing is not feasible, a
rotational design (f) can be employed where the successional
period during tree development is determined by a range of
factors similar to those used to determine the length of fallow
needed in shifting cultivation. A thorough understanding of
the interaction, integration, and interdependency of all components of the system will ultimately help in determining
trees’ spatial arrangement and how it may change over time.

An agroforestry system with great complexity and diversity, as well as opportunities for maintaining a mosaic of
stages of succession, is the tropical home garden system. It
is probably one of the most complex and interesting types
of agroecosystems, and one we have much to learn from
regarding resource management for a sustainable agriculture (Méndez 2000; Nair 2001; Kumar and Nair 2004)
(Figure 18.10).

The home garden is an integrated ecosystem of humans,
plants, animals, soils, and water, with trees playing key
ecological roles. It usually occupies a well-defined area,
between 0.5 and 2.0 ha in size, in close proximity to a
dwelling. Rich in plant species, home gardens are usually
dominated by woody perennials; a mixture of annuals and
perennials of different heights forms layers of vegetation
resembling a natural forest structure. The high diversity of
species permits year-round harvesting of food products and
a wide range of other useful products, such as firewood,
medicinal plants, spices, and ornamentals. Tropical home
gardens also provide good opportunities for incorporating
domestic animals such as chickens (Méndez et al. 2001;
Del Angel-Perez and Mendoza 2004; Kehlenbeck and
Maass 2005).


**High Diversity**
The ecological diversity of home gardens—including
diversity of species, structure, function, and vertical and
horizontal arrangement—is remarkably high. Two examples
serve as illustrations.


In a study of home gardens in both upland and lowland sites in Mexico, it was found that in quite small areas
(between 0.3 and 0.7 ha) high diversity permitted the maintenance of gardens that in many aspects were similar to the
local natural ecosystems (Allison 1983). The gardens studied
had relatively high indices of diversity for cropping systems
(see Table 18.4), and had leaf area indices and cover levels

that approximated the much more complex natural ecosystems of the surrounding regions.

In another study (Ewel et al. 1982), in which nine different tropical ecosystems were analyzed for a series of ecosystem characteristics, a 40-year-old home garden was found to
have the most evenly distributed canopy—one that was fairly
uniformly stratified from ground level to more than 14 m in
height. Its leaf area index was 3.9 and its percent cover 100%,
and the leaf biomass per square meter (307 g/m [2] ) was the
next to highest among all of the ecosystems examined. Total
root biomass per square meter down to a depth of 25 cm was
identical to leaf biomass. Perhaps most importantly, of the
nine systems tested, the first 25 cm of the home garden’s soil
had the highest small-diameter (<5 cm) root surface area per
area of ground surface. These traits are indicative of an ecologically efficient system, especially in its ability to capture
light, garner nutrients in the upper layers of the soil, store
nutrients in the aboveground biomass, and reduce the impact
of rain and sun on the soil.


The trees in a home garden—and the way in which they
are managed by their human caretakers—make possible
much of the garden’s diversity, complexity, and efficient
functioning. Carbon dioxide trapped between canopy layers
might be able to stimulate photosynthetic activity, and the
layers themselves may increase habitat diversity for birds and
insects useful for maintaining biological control in the system. The trees’ roots prevent nutrients from leaching out of
the system, and the trees’ leaf litter recycles nutrients back
into the rest of the system.


**Multiple Uses and Functions**
An important characteristic of home gardens is their multifaceted usefulness. The trees can produce food, such as
coconuts, that can serve as either subsistence food or a cash
crop. The woody parts of trees can be used for both firewood


Disturbance, Succession, and Agroecosystem Management **233**


and construction material. The diversity of food types from
both plants and animals provides a varied diet balanced in
carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, and minerals (Dewey
1979; Dharmasena and Wijeratne 1996). Due to the mixture
of species and their variability in flowering time and fruit
maturity, there is always something ready to be harvested,
ensuring sources of food or income throughout the entire
year (Gliessman 1990).



The home garden can have such social or aesthetic functions as serving as an indication of the social status of the
owner or beautifying or improving the environment directly
associated with the house. At the same time, the gardens have
an important economic function for rural families. In studies
in Java it was found that between 20% and 30% of the annual

income of many households was obtained from their home
gardens (Hisyam et al. 1979). Production in local gardens fell
considerably during the rice harvest when labor was concentrated on this essential food and cash crop, but during the rest
of the year, activity in the gardens was quite high.

A case study in Nicaragua found that agroforestry home
gardens were important to household livelihoods for both
income generation and products for consumption (Méndez
2000; Méndez et al. 2001). On average, households derived
34% of their income from sales of home garden products,
and in 3 cases out of the 20 studied, it was the only source of
income. In addition, families reported obtaining at least 40
different types of plant products from their gardens, including firewood, fruit, timber, and medicinal plants. The authors
found a relationship between the level of dependence on the
home gardens for products and income and the number of
plant species and management zones. Although dependence
on home gardens varied, they represent a reliable and flexible resource that is held in high esteem by the families that
maintain them.


**Dynamic Change**
The few long-term studies of home gardens that have been
carried out have shown that the gardens are dynamic and
changing. In a study in Costa Rica, a home garden near
Puerto Viejo was shown to be in the process of change due
to a need for cash income, as well as the limited availability of both land and labor (Flietner 1985). The tree stratum
in approximately half of the 3264 m [2] garden was in the
process of being replaced with coconuts planted in evenly
spaced rows, and the understory had been planted to pure
stands of yuca ( _Manihot esculenta_ ) and pineapple ( _Ananas_
_comosus_ ). With the construction of an all-weather road to
the region, trucks had become much more available for
hauling produce to distant urban markets, creating a demand
for crops such as coconut and pineapple that a few years
before did not exist. Farmers were adjusting their agroecosystems to meet this demand. Also, the farmer of the study
garden had recently taken a job off the farm and was much
less able to meet the management needs that a more diverse
home garden would require.

As the coconuts mature and generate a much shadier environment on the ground below them, the farmer will have to

decide what shifts will be necessary in the understory plants.
He or she may shift to the malanga ( _Colocasia esculenta_ ),
common already in the shadier parts of the garden. He or she
may also decide to clear out part of the tree crop in order to
reintegrate more of the annual crops and short-lived perennials that were common earlier in the development of the
system (Figure 18.11).

In a home garden system studied in Cañas, Guanacaste,
Costa Rica, interesting shifts in diversity and organization of
the garden were observed to take place from 1 year to the next
(Gliessman 1990), as can be seen from the data in Table 18.5.
The total number of species in the garden increased by 12,
but more impressive is the major increase in total number of
individual plants. A large part of this increase came primarily from the greater predominance of ornamental species the
second year, along with more medicinal and spice species.


**234** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



Some of the food species that had been very common the
year before, such as squash, were not present in l986 due to a
drought that had eliminated seedlings planted earlier.

Some of the changes in the garden can be traced to
changes in the household’s economic situation. In 1986, the
woman of the household had less time to care for the garden
since she and her daughters had begun a small-scale baking
business making bread for sale in the local community. If the
baking business fails, food crops will probably once again
receive greater emphasis.

Even though socioeconomic factors account for part of
the change in the garden, some of it occurs for ecological
reasons. Change in home gardens is ongoing and sometimes quite rapid because of the shifting dynamics of the
disturbance–recovery process.


**Links with the Social System**
As indicated by the studies described earlier, social and economic factors can have significant impacts on home garden
systems and the way they are managed. A long-term study
of traditional agriculture in Tlaxcala, Mexico (GonzálezJácome 1985) found that changes took place in home garden
diversity, structure, and management in response to industrialization and population increase. In general, farmers
reduced the number of species in their home gardens, used
more orderly and easily managed cropping patterns, and
planted species that could more easily enter the cash economy. However, because Tlaxcala has gone through several
“boom and bust” cycles over a longer time period, where
off-farm employment has been alternately available and then
limited, farmers have a certain mistrust of job security off
the farm. As a result, relatively diverse agroecosystems have
been maintained even in times of off-farm employment as
insurance against the probable loss of the outside income.

Regional population growth has had a mixed impact
on home garden structure. Since Tlaxcala is close to the
large and expanding urban-industrial centers of Puebla and
Mexico City, there is considerable demand and market for
a large variety of agricultural products, from basic corn and
beans to cut flowers. This demand is a stimulus to diversify
the local cropping systems, but it also puts pressure on farmers to emphasize cash crops and abandon many subsistence
species. Those families that see an advantage in combining
both cash and subsistence crops maintain the most diverse
home gardens, while others shift to mostly cash crops.

Although regional economic change has a clear impact on
home gardens, the link between the two can go in the other
direction as well. Where they exist, home gardens tend to
stabilize the local economy and social structure by giving
families a means of economic survival. They act as a bridge
between the traditional local economy and the modern industrial economy, helping to buffer the forces that encourage
migration to industrial centers and abandonment of traditional social ties. By offering the possibility of local autonomy, economic equity, and ecological sustainability, they



provide important examples that can be adapted and applied
around the world (Méndez et al. 2001; Major et al. 2005).


**DISTURBANCE, RECOVERY,**

**AND SUSTAINABILITY**


Agroforestry and home garden agroecosystems have been
examined in this chapter because of their usefulness as models of sustainable agriculture. They incorporate a range of
desirable characteristics applicable and adaptable to any
agroecosystem. Manageable and productive, they have the
ability to respond to different factors or conditions in the
environment, to meet the needs of the inhabitants for a great
diversity of products and materials, and to respond to external socioeconomic demands. At the same time, they are not
dependent on expensive imported agricultural inputs, and
have very limited negative environmental impacts.

More information on existing types of successionally
developed systems, especially those with perennial shrubs
and trees, is desperately needed. Urbanization and the rapid
move toward agroecosystem simplification and cash cropping
are threatening the existence of these systems, especially in
developing countries. We need to locate, describe, and monitor existing systems that incorporate traditional knowledge of
the management of succession and disturbance with selected
agroecologically based improvements. Moreover, studies of
such systems (e.g., Berkes et al. 2000; Altieri 2002) require
more institutional support.

Perhaps the greatest value of agroforestry systems is that
they offer principles that can be applied to agroecosystems
with few trees or none at all. By viewing all agroecosystems
as successional systems in which we incorporate perennial
species, appropriately introduce disturbance, and promote
recovery from disturbance, we can make important steps
toward sustainable food production. The limits are set only
by the kind of mature ecosystems that would naturally occur
in a region, and the human component in the design and management of sustainable alternatives that build upon such ecosystem models. Regardless of whether they are grain systems
or home gardens, they must be dynamic, diverse, and flexible, incorporating the important ecosystem characteristics
of resilience and resistance to disturbance, and the ability to
constantly be renewed and regenerated by the recovery process of succession.


The more widespread implementation of practices based
on disturbance and recovery will involve considerable
research. But it can lead to the development of an agricultural landscape that is a mosaic of agroecosystems. The need
for high harvestable yields could come from annual and
short-lived perennial crops, grown in polycultures of several
species that are ecologically complementary and interdependent. In such systems, animals could once again play important roles in nutrient cycling. Field structure and organization
could change over time as succession leads to a gradual conversion to long-lived perennials. And incorporated into the


Disturbance, Succession, and Agroecosystem Management **235**



disturbance cycle could be a patchwork of rotations in which
areas are allowed to develop to maturity and their perennial
or tree vegetation harvested or recycled to open up parts of
the agroecosystem once again for annual cropping. In the
end, a sustainable mosaic could be achieved.


**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**


1. How similar or different are the ecological impacts

of human-induced disturbances in agroecosystems
to those of disturbances in natural ecosystems?
2. Describe how the “analog model” for agroecosys
tem design and management might be applied in
your own farming region. Be sure to clearly indicate
the successional stages your system would need to
go through and how they mirror what happens in
the natural ecosystems that exist (or once existed)
around your farm.
3. Give some examples of how agroforestry system

design can be informed by the knowledge about the
ecological impact of trees on the environment, and
how it can be shaped by the farmer’s need for particular products.
4. How would you integrate both ecological balance

and harvestability in the design of a home garden
agroforestry system specifically suited to the location in which you live? Be sure to describe both the
ecological and cultural backgrounds that affect your
design determinations.
5. Why have trees disappeared from so many agricul
tural landscapes over the past several decades, especially in developed countries?
6. From an agroecological perspective, what are some

of the most important relationships between diversity and disturbance in sustainable agriculture?
7. Describe how an agricultural landscape made up of

a mosaic of successional patches might be described
as a “polyculture of monocultures.”
