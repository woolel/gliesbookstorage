## 5. Temperature

The effect of temperature on the growth and development of
plants and animals is well known and easily demonstrated.
Each organism has certain limits of tolerance for high and
low temperatures, determined by its particular adaptations
for temperature extremes. Each organism also has an optimum temperature range, which can vary depending on the
stage of development. Because of their different reactions
to temperature, papayas are not planted in the cool coastal
temperate environment of the Monterey Bay of California,
and apples would not do well if planted in the humid tropical
lowlands of Tabasco, Mexico.

Thus the temperature range and degree of temperature
fluctuation in an area can set limits on the crop species and
cultivars that a farmer can grow, and can cause variations
in quality and average yield for the crops that are grown.
In selecting crops, it is necessary to consider the range of
temperature conditions that might occur from day to day,
between day and night, and from season to season. And one
must be concerned with both aboveground temperatures
and those belowground. Farmers need to consider also the
many ways in which it is possible to modify the temperature
environment in which crops grow. Putting all these variables
together, it can be seen that agroecosystem management with
respect to temperature involves potentially complex interactions among management actions, plants’ responses to temperature, the potential range of temperatures in a region, and
the actual temperatures to which crops are exposed.

The natural unpredictability of the weather makes the
temperature-related management of agroecosystems difficult
enough; as the climate changes in the coming decades, taking into account the temperature factor will become increasingly challenging—and increasingly vital.


**SUN AS THE SOURCE OF HEAT**

**ENERGY ON EARTH**


When we measure the temperature of the air, soil, or water,
we are measuring heat flow. In order to more fully understand temperature as a factor, it is useful to think of this heat
flow as part of the energy budget of the ecosystem, the basis
of which is solar energy.

The energy flowing from the sun is predominantly shortwave radiation, usually thought of as light energy made up
of both visible and invisible spectra. Recall that the fate
of this energy once it reaches the atmosphere of the earth
was discussed in the previous chapter and diagrammed in
Figure 4.1. To review, incoming solar radiation is either
reflected, dispersed, or absorbed by the atmosphere and its



contents. Reflected and dispersed energy is little changed, but
absorbed energy is converted to a long-wave form of energy
manifested as heat. Similarly, the short-wave energy that
reaches the earth’s surface is either reflected or absorbed. The
absorption process at the surface, by which short-wave light
energy is converted into long-wave heat energy, is known as
**insolation** . Heat formed by insolation can be stored in the
surface, or reradiated back into the atmosphere. Some of the
heat reradiated into the atmosphere can also be reflected back
to the surface.


As a result of these processes, heat energy is trapped
at and near the earth’s surface, and the temperature there
remains relatively high compared to the extreme cold of the
upper atmosphere and of outer space. Overall, this warming
process is termed the greenhouse effect.

Temperatures at the earth’s surface vary from place to
place, from night to day, and from summer to winter; nevertheless, a rough overall equilibrium is maintained between
the heat energy gained by the earth and its atmosphere, and
the heat energy lost. This balance between heating and cooling is represented in the following equation:


_S_ (1 −α) + _L_ d − _L_ u ± _H_ air ± _H_ evap ± _H_ soil = 0


where


_S_ is the solar gain
α is the albedo of the earth’s surface (with a value between

0 and 1)
_L_ d is the flux of long-wave heat energy to the surface
_L_ u is the flux of long-wave heat energy away from the

surface

_H_ is the gain or loss of heat energy from air, soil, and

water (evap)


This equilibrium is currently undergoing a shift in response
to human-induced changes in the atmosphere—in particular,
increases in carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels

and increases in other “greenhouse gases” such as methane.
As more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere, more
heat is trapped between the atmosphere and the surface. The
amount of heat gained by the earth needs to be only slightly
greater than the amount lost for the overall temperature to rise.
The major concern—not just for agriculture—is that solar
gain is going to remain positive for a very long time, causing
average temperatures to continue to increase. This is because
the changes humans have made to the atmosphere are very
long lasting and because we will continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere for the foreseeable future.

There is also the problem of positive feedback loops. In
some of these loops, warming creates more warming. This is
occurring in the arctic, for example, as highly reflective ice is
replaced by highly absorptive open water and land. In other
feedback loops, warmer temperatures cause more release of
greenhouse gases, the underlying cause of warming. This,
too, is occurring in the arctic, as warming temperatures melt
permafrost, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide and the
particularly potent greenhouse gas methane.


**PATTERNS OF TEMPERATURE VARIATION**

**ON THE EARTH’S SURFACE**


There are several ecological aspects to temperature distribution that are useful for understanding the variation and
dynamics of temperature conditions at the surface. We need
to know this information, first of all, not only to make the
proper selections of our crop types, but also to adapt agroecosystems to temperature conditions and to alter these conditions where possible.

Temperature variation occurs at the largest scale when
we consider world climates, made up of the seasonal patterns of temperature, rainfall, wind, and relative humidity.
At the other end of the scale, important variation also occurs
at the micro level when we consider the temperature conditions inside a crop canopy or those just below the surface of
the soil.


**L** **atitudinal** **V** **ariation**


The amount of solar radiation actually absorbed by the
surface over a particular period of time is affected greatly
by latitude. At or near the equator, incoming radiation
strikes the earth’s surface at a vertical angle. At increasing
distances from the equator, however, the sun’s rays strike
the surface at an increasingly shallow angle. As this angle
becomes shallower, the same amount of incoming solar
radiation is spread over a larger and larger area of the earth’s
surface, as shown in Figure 5.1. In addition, the sun’s rays
must pass through an increasingly thick atmospheric layer
at higher latitudes, resulting in a loss of energy to reflection
and scattering by materials in the atmosphere, such as water
droplets and dust. The overall effect is a regular decline in
the intensity of solar radiation per square unit of surface as
one moves away from the equator. This latitudinal variation
in solar gain is one of the major causes of latitudinal variations in temperature.


**A** **ltitudinal** **V** **ariation**


At any latitude, as altitude increases, temperature decreases.
On the average, for each 100 m of elevation gain, ambient
temperature drops approximately 0.5°C. In locations where
increased cloud cover during the day is associated with this
elevation gain, temperature differences can be even greater
due to reduced solar gain. At the same time, the increasing



**FIGURE 5.1** **The effect of latitude on solar gain.** The higher
the latitude, the greater the distance that solar radiation must travel
through the atmosphere ( _D_ 2 - _D_ 1 ) and the greater the surface area
over which a certain amount of solar radiation is spread ( _A_ 2 - _A_ 1 ).


thinness of the atmosphere at higher altitude results in a
greater loss of heat from both the soil surface and the air just
above it by reradiation at night. This phenomenon contributes significantly to lower nighttime temperatures at elevations much above sea level. In mountainous regions at high
elevations in the tropics (above 3000 m) and at progressively
lower elevations as one moves toward the poles, reradiation at
night is so intense that wintertime temperature conditions are
encountered almost every night the sky is clear.


**S** **easonal** **V** **ariation**


Seasonal differences in temperatures over the surface of the
earth are the result of changes in the orientation of the earth
in relation to the sun as it revolves around the sun on its tilted

axis. Through the course of the year, a belt of maximum solar
gain or insolation moves back and forth across the equator
in relation to the angle of incidence of the sun’s rays and the
length of the day. Longer days lead to more solar gain. This
swing in insolation is the direct cause of a seasonal swing
in temperature. The degree of seasonal variation in average
temperatures increases with increasing distance from the
equator (Figure 5.2).


**M** **aritime** **vs** **. C** **ontinental** **I** **nfluence**


Large bodies of water, especially the oceans, greatly affect
the temperature of adjacent land masses. Because water
reflects a larger proportion of insolation in relation to land,
loses heat readily through surface evaporation, has a high
specific heat, and readily mixes layers vertically, the temperature of large bodies of water is slower to change than
that of land masses. Land heats up more during the summer
because all the absorbed heat stays in the surface horizon

and the atmosphere close to that surface, and it cools to a
lower temperature during the winter because of reradiation
and heat loss. Water masses are therefore moderators of broad
fluctuation in temperature, tending to lower temperatures in
the summer and to raise temperatures in the winter. This
water- or marine-mediated effect on temperature is called a
**maritime influence**, in contrast to the more widely fluctuating variations in temperature encountered at a distance from
water under a **continental influence** . Maritime influences
help create the unique Mediterranean climates of such places
as coastal California and Chile, where nearby upwelling cold
currents accentuate the moderating influences during the dry
summer season (Figures 5.3 and 5.4).


**T** **opographic** **V** **ariation**


Slope orientation and topography introduce variation in temperature as well, especially at the local level. For example,
slopes that face toward the sun as a result of the inclination
of the earth on its axis experience more solar gain, especially in the winter months. Hence, an equator-facing slope
is significantly warmer than a pole-facing slope—all other

factors being equal—and offers unique microclimates for

crop management.

Valleys surrounded by mountain slopes create unique
microclimates as well. In many parts of the world air that
moves downslope due to winds or pressure differences can
rapidly expand and heat up as it descends, a process known
as katabatic warming. (The wind associated with this phenomenon will be discussed in Chapter 7.) As the air is
warmed, its ability to hold moisture in vapor form (relative
humidity) goes up, increasing the evaporative potential of
the warmer air.


Valleys are subject to nighttime microclimate variation as
well. On the higher elevation slopes above a valley, reradiation occurs more rapidly; since the cooled air that results is
heavier than the warmer air below, the cooler air begins to
flow downslope, a phenomenon called **cold air drainage** .
Often this cooler air passes under warmer air, pushing the
warmer air above it and forming an **inversion**, in which a

latitude and elevation, but coastal San Francisco has a maritime climate, and Stockton, 100 km to the east, is under more of a continental
influence. (Data from Conway, M. and Liston, L. (ed.), _The Weather Handbook_, Conway Data, Atlanta, GA, 1990.)

**FIGURE 5.5** **Cold air drainage and inversion layer.** Cold air can drain into valley bottoms at night and pool beneath a layer of

warmer layer of air becomes “sandwiched” between two layers of colder air. In some locations, the cold pocket of air can
lead to frost formation and plant damage, whereas the warm
air inversion just above it stays significantly warmer. This pattern of local temperature variation is illustrated in Figure 5.5.
The planting of frost-sensitive citrus between 500 and 1000 ft
elevation on the lower slopes of the foothills of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains of the Central Valley of California is a
good example of how farmers have learned to take advantage
of a wintertime inversion layer of warmer air that is forced up
by the drainage of colder air into a valley floor below.


**D** **escribing** **T** **emperature** **V** **ariation**


Holding constant the variable of geographic location, the
temperature variations that occur in any particular location
over time make up a major component of that place’s climate
(another major component, precipitation, is discussed in the
following chapter). When temperature data are collected for a
certain location over a long period of time, these data form a
climatological record that shows how temperature has varied
with the time of year at that place. The most useful patterns,
in an agroecological sense, that can be drawn from such a
record relate to extremes at both the high and low ends of the
temperature scale and to various averages.


**• Lowest annual minimum.** Regardless of the date,

what’s the coldest possible temperature (or the coldest ever recorded) at a location on the earth? This
aspect of the temperature factor, discussed below in
terms of climate zones, is the most crucial for perennial crops in temperate zones because, exposed to
temperatures below a certain level, some plants will
suffer damage or die.

**• Highest annual maximum.** Regardless of the date,

what’s the hottest possible temperature (or the hottest ever recorded)? Although it is not a determinant of climate zone, this aspect of climate can be
as important as lowest annual minimum because of



the damaging effects of extreme heat on plant tissue, growth, and reproduction.

**• Highest daily maximum and lowest daily mini-**

**mum.** What are the highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded at a location on a certain date?

Because nearly all crops in temperate climates are
grown on a seasonal cycle, the seasonal timing of
extreme heat and cold can be important. For example, farmers may want to know the record lows for
each date during spring to learn when they can
safely plant a frost-sensitive crop.

**• Average daily maximum and minimum.** What

are the typical high and low temperatures for a
location on a certain date? Date-referenced aver
ages tell farmers when to expect conditions that are
most optimal for growth of a particular crop, which
determines sowing time, choice of crop or variety,
and sometimes harvest time.

**• Magnitude of difference between the average**

**daily high and low.** Are nighttime lows and daytime highs not widely separated or are they very different? Some crops prefer one type of regime, others
prefer the opposite. Zinfandel grapes, for example,
do best with a wide daily temperature range—hot
days for optimal plant development and cool nights
for optimal fruit development.

**• Duration of extreme heat or cold.** For how many

successive days may the temperature drop below a
certain critical threshold at night? For how many
successive days may it reach above a certain temperature? For many crop plants with some ability
to withstand extreme heat or cold, what may matter
most is the amount of time they spend outside the
zone of tolerance.


The temperature patterns encoded in a climatological
record tell a farmer what is likely to happen with regard
to temperature and what kinds of extremes are possible.
This information, as mentioned earlier, can be important


Temperature **59**



in choosing crop types and planting dates. In addition, the
climatological record provides a baseline against which
deviations from “normal” can be measured, described, and
understood. New record highs and record lows for particular dates, months, seasons, or all time make up one important category of temperature deviation. Another type of
deviation is the magnitude of the difference between the
climatological average maximum or maximum for a certain date and the actual observed temperature; adding the
dimension of duration, we can begin to quantify such events
as an “unusual hot spell.”


**E** **ffects** **of** **C** **limate** **C** **hange** **on** **T** **emperature**


The general patterns of geographic and seasonal temperature
variation discussed in the earlier text will continue to hold

true as the earth gradually warms. Climate change, however,
will add extra layers and degrees of variability and unpredictability as well as a general warming trend, both of which
may have significant effects on agriculture. Some of the most
important changes that can be expected are the following:


  - Temperature in general will increase in many areas

of the world. Broadly speaking, this will entail
increases in the average high for each day of the
year, the average low for each day, the overall average for longer periods of time like months and seasons, the annual minimum temperature, and the
annual maximum temperature.

  - Areas closer to the poles are likely to see larger

increases in average and maximum temperatures
than areas near the equator.

  - In many areas with temperate climates, the number

of frost-free days will increase.

  - Weather and climate variability are likely to

increase in most areas, which means that extreme
temperatures will increase in both frequency and
magnitude. While record-breaking heat will be the
most common type of extreme that occurs, an overall increase in temperature variability means that
extreme and unseasonable low temperatures will
also be possible.

  - Periods of extreme heat harmful to many types of

crops will increase in frequency and in length. They
may also begin to occur uncharacteristically early
and late in seasonally anchored agricultural cycles.

  - Other weather-related factors that interact with


temperature and mediate temperature’s effects on
crop pants, such as humidity, rainfall, and wind, are
likely to become more variable and less predictable
along with temperature.


These changes in temperature patterns are all predicted by
long-term climate models, which vary in their specifics but
agree on the general patterns. Adding to the degree of certainty in these predictions is the fact that all of these changes
are already happening; decades of weather data from much



of the world show a general warming and a general increase
in temperature variability.

Overall, the shifts in temperature patterns brought about
by climate change are likely to be a mixed bag for agriculture. On the one hand, longer growing seasons and fewer
frost-free days mean that some areas formerly too cold for
agriculture (at both higher latitudes and higher altitudes) will
be opened up to food production. And these same changes
have the potential for making some temperate farming areas
more productive and able to grow a wider variety of crops.
However, the increasing likelihood of periods of extreme
heat and extreme cold will increase the risk of crop failure
and yield-reducing temperature damage, and some areas
may actually become too hot for agriculture. Also, a general
warming at the low end of the temperature spectrum will
allow some crop pests and disease organisms to spread northward and southward toward the poles into areas where they
were formerly excluded by freezing temperatures.


**RESPONSES OF PLANTS TO TEMPERATURE**


All physiological processes in plants—including germination, flowering, growth, photosynthesis, and respiration—
have limits of tolerance for temperature extremes, and a
relatively narrow temperature range at which functioning
is optimized. Thus the temperature regime to which a plant
is exposed is ultimately connected to its yield potential. For
example, temperature conditions may allow a plant to establish and grow, but then a sudden change in the weather (e.g.,
a cold spell) might prevent it from flowering and setting fruit
and producing seed.

Farmers must carefully adapt their practices to the local
temperature regime, taking into account diurnal variations,
seasonal variations, moderating influences, microclimate,
other temperature-related factors, and the particular temperature responses of specific crops. In California, for example,
farmers shift to cool-season varieties of crops such as broccoli for winter planting, plant covercrops during the wet and
cool time of the year when many vegetable crops would not
do well, plant avocado trees close to the coast in areas that are
frost-free because of the maritime influence, and plant lettuce
during the winter in the interior desert valleys of southern
California. Other farming regions offer similar examples.

Because of its effect on plants, temperature can also be
used as a tool to cause desired changes in plants. For example,
farmers in central coastal California chill strawberry transplants for several weeks before planting in order to induce
vegetative growth and good crown development.


**A** **daptations** **to** **T** **emperature** **E** **xtremes**


Natural ecosystems are made up of plants and animals that
have been “screened” by natural selection. Periodic temperature extremes are some of the factors that have eliminated those species that are not tolerant of local conditions.
Therefore, we can expect the temperature range tolerances of
the species of local natural systems to give us an indication


**60** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems


of the temperature extremes we might expect when we try
to farm in an area. Recognizing these indicators, as well as
selecting for adaptations to extremes in our crop species, can
help in the development of farming systems that lower the
risk associated with the natural variability in temperature
extremes. As the climate changes over time, farmers may
have to shift their practices appropriately.



**Heat**

The effects of high temperatures on crops are the result of a
complex interaction between evaporative water loss, changes
in internal water status, and changes in other physiological
processes. Heat stress causes a decline in metabolic activity, which is thought to come about from the inactivation
of enzymes and other proteins. Heat also raises the rate of
respiration, which can eventually overtake the rate of photosynthesis, halting plant growth and ultimately killing plant
tissue. Even when heat does not cause outright damage to
crop plants, it can reduce the rate of growth and the crops’
eventual yield.

Heat can also significantly impact crop plants’ reproductive processes, which for grains, pulses, oilseeds, and many
other seed and fruit crops is fundamental to yield. Many crops
are particularly sensitive to heat during pollination or fruit
set. If extreme heat occurs during the time that corn plants
are silking, for example, it can have devastating effects. Heat
slows the growth of silks, delaying the time they become
receptive to pollen; if the delay is long enough, much of the
pollen may already be shed. Heat also tends to dessicate the
silks, greatly reducing their capacity to support pollen tube
growth and thus seed fertilization. Heat also reduces pollen
formation and greatly shortens the period of pollen viability.

Plants native to temperate areas generally have lower limits to temperature stress than plants of more tropical areas.
In all cases, though, leaf functions become impaired at about
42°C (108°F), and lethal temperatures for active leaf tissue
are reached in the range of 50°C–60°C.

Common morphological adaptations of plants to excess
heat include


 - A high CO 2 compensation point for the photosyn
thesis/respiration ratio, often aided by changes in
leaf structure;

  - White or gray leaves that reflect light and thus

absorb less heat;

  - Hairs (pubescence) on the leaves that insulate leaf

tissue;

  - Small leaves with less surface area exposed to

sunlight;

  - Leaves with a lower surface-to-volume ratio for


gaining less heat;

  - Vertical orientation of leaves to reduce heat gain;

  - More extensive roots, or a greater root-to-shoot

ratio, for absorbing more water to offset water loss
from the leaves or to maintain more water intake

relative to leaf area;



**FIGURE 5.6** **Artichokes near Castroville, CA, damaged by**
**a very unusual late-season frost.** Long-term upward shifts in
average temperatures coupled with occasional low-temperature
extremes can pose a potent threat to cold-sensitive crops.


  - Thick, corky or fibrous bark that insulates the cam
bium and phloem in the plant trunk;

  - Lower moisture content of the protoplasm and

higher osmotic concentration of the living tissue.


These characters can be incorporated into farming systems
where water availability is limited and temperatures are high,
either through the use of crop plants with these characters, or
through the breeding of varieties that show them.


**Cold**

When temperatures drop below the minimum required for
growth, a plant can become dormant, even though metabolic activity may slowly continue. Chlorosis may occur,
followed eventually by death of the tissue. Death at low
temperature is due to protein precipitation (which can occur
at temperatures above freezing), the drawing of water out
of the protoplasm when intercellular water freezes, and the
formation of damaging ice crystals inside the protoplasm
itself (Figure 5.6).

Resistance to extremes of cold depends greatly on the
degree and duration of the low temperature, how quickly the
cold temperature comes about, and the complex of environmental conditions that the plant may have undergone before
the cold event. Some specific structural adaptations provide
resistance as well, such as coverings of wax or pubescence
that allow leaves to endure extended cold without freezing
the interior tissue, or the presence of smaller cells in the
leaf that resist freezing.

Temporary cold hardiness can be induced in some plants
by short-term exposure to temperatures a few degrees above
freezing or withholding water for a few days. Such plants
undergo **hardening**, giving them limited resistance to
extreme cold when it occurs. Greenhouse-grown seedlings
can be hardened to cold by exposing them to cooler temperatures in a shade house and cutting back on irrigation for a few
days before transplanting to the field.

**SPECIAL TOPIC: SHIFTING CLIMATE ZONES**

One of the most basic elements of place-based agroecological knowledge is encapsulated in the following question,
_What’s the coldest temperature that’s likely to occur here?_ This factor is key because in temperate climates the average minimum temperature at a particular location limits what perennial plants can be grown there more than any other
single environmental factor. If a plant experiences temperatures below its range of tolerance, it will be damaged or killed
outright—something a farmer or horticulturalist clearly wants to avoid.

For a very long time, farmers and gardeners could consider the average minimum temperature of a place to be fixed,
much like the hours of sunlight on the summer solstice. But a few decades ago, this aspect of climate began to change.
The average minimum temperature began to slowly increase in many locations as winters became a little warmer.

In the United States, farmers and gardeners could see graphic evidence of the poleward retreat of cold winter temperatures when the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) released a new version of its much-used plant hardiness zone map
in 2012. This map shows climate zones within which the average minimum temperature is within a 10°F range (along
with subzones based on a 5°F range). Based on temperature data from 1976 to 2005, the zones on the new map are clearly
different from those on the previous map from 1990, which were based on data collected from 1974 to 1986.

The new map shows that more than a third of the United States is now in a warmer subzone than it was in 1990, and
about 20% has shifted a whole zone. Nebraska, for example, was mostly in USDA zone 4 in 1990 but now is almost
entirely in zone 5. The general warming of winter temperatures in temperate zones around the world is expected to
continue—and the pace of change to accelerate—in the coming years, with significant consequences for agriculture.

The 2012 USDA plant hardiness zone map can be viewed at http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/



Many plants are adapted to extreme cold through mechanisms that allow them to avoid cold. Deciduous perennial
shrubs or trees that lose their leaves and go dormant during the
cold period, bulbous plants that die back to the belowground
plant parts, and annuals that complete their life cycle and produce seeds, are all examples of plants avoiding cold.


**T** **hermoperiod** **in** **P** **lants**


Some plants need daily variation in temperature for optimal
growth or development. In a classic paper in ecophysiology
(Went 1944), it was demonstrated that tomato plants grown
with equal day and night temperatures did not develop as
well as tomato plants grown with normal day temperatures
and lower night temperatures. This response occurs when the
optimal temperature for growth—which takes place mostly
at night—is substantially different from the optimal temperature for photosynthesis—which takes place during the day.

Diurnal variation in temperature is encountered by plants
in many natural ecosystems and open-field agroecosystems,
but in very controlled agroecosystems, such as greenhouses,
the diurnal temperature variation is much less pronounced.
In other situations, plants from climates with cool nights do
not do as well in regions with relatively constant day and
night temperatures, such as the humid tropics or in temperate
continental regions during the summertime.


**V** **ernalization**


Some plants need to undergo a period of cold, called **ver-**
**nalization**, before certain developmental processes can take
place. For example, in the California grasslands, many native
herbaceous species will not germinate until after a cold spell
of several days duration, even though rainfall may have



already occurred. Since the timing of the first rain of the season in this area is highly variable and early rain is usually followed by a very dry spell before more consistent precipitation
begins, if germination were to occur with the initial rainfall,
most of the new seedlings would probably not survive. There
is thus a selective advantage to delaying germination until
after vernalization has occurred.


Many agricultural and horticultural plants respond to
vernalization. Lily bulbs, for example, are treated with cold
at the appropriate time before planting so that they can be
blooming for Easter in north temperate areas. In other cases,
seeds of crops are treated with cold before planting in order
to ensure more uniform germination.


**MICROCLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE**


Temperature has thus far been discussed as a factor of climate. Climate is made up of the fairly predictable, but highly
variable, patterns in atmospheric conditions that occur over
the long term in a certain geographic area. Climatology, or
the study of climatic patterns, can tell us what the average
temperatures for any particular part of the earth might be, and
the degree of variation from the average that can be expected.
There is little chance in the near future that humans will be

able to intentionally modify climate on any kind of large
scale. This is especially true for temperature. The large-scale
aspects of climate, such as cold fronts, wind storms, and rainfall patterns, are best dealt with by selecting crops adapted to
the range of climatic conditions that are expected.

But at the level of the individual crop organism or crop field,
there is an aspect of climate that can be managed—the **micro-**
**climate** . Microclimate is the localized conditions of temperature, humidity, and atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of an
organism. According to some definitions, the microclimate is


**62** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



made up of the conditions in a zone four times the height of the
organism being considered. Although microclimate includes
factors other than temperature, farmers are most likely to be
concerned with temperature when modifying microclimate or
taking advantage of microclimatic variations.


**M** **icroclimatic** **P** **rofile**


Within a cropping system, the conditions of temperature,
moisture, light, wind, and atmospheric quality vary with specific location. Conditions just above the canopy of the cropping system can be very different from those in the interior,
at the soil surface, and below the soil into the root zone. The
specific microclimatic conditions along a vertical transect
within a cropping system form what is called the microclimatic profile of the system. Both the structure of the system
and the activities of the component parts have impact on the
microclimatic profile. The profile also changes as the component plant species develop.

Figure 5.7 shows the microclimatic profile of a corn, bean,
and squash intercropping system in a schematic form, with
each factor measured in relative terms through five layers
of the canopy. In such a system, the microclimatic profile is
very different at each stage of development, from early germination to full growth.

The belowground microclimate profile is also important;
it extends from the soil surface to a small distance below the

deepest roots of the crop plants. Under certain circumstances,
the conditions to which a crop is subjected may be so different at different zones in the microhabitat as to cause problems for the crop. For example, warm wind currents when
the soil is very cold can cause desiccation of the aboveground
part of the plant since the roots are unable to absorb water
fast enough to offset water loss.


**M** **odifying** **the** **T** **emperature** **M** **icroclimate**


Through appropriate design and management, the microclimate of a system can be modified. Such modification is



especially important if the goal of the farmer is to create or
maintain microclimatic conditions that favor the sustainability of the cropping system. If this is the case, each modification must be evaluated as much as for its contribution to

short-term yield and market return as for its contribution to
the longer-term sustainability of the system.

Although microclimate includes many factors, its modification is often focused specifically on temperature. Practices
and techniques used to modify the temperature microclimate
are described in the following. Although modification of
temperature is the main purpose of these practices, they will
also impact other factors of the microclimate, such as humidity and light.


**Canopy Vegetation**
Trees or other tall plants that create a canopy over the other
plants in a system can greatly modify the temperature conditions under the canopy. Shade from the canopy reduces
solar gain at the surface of the soil, as well as helping the
soil retain moisture. Agroforestry systems in the tropics are a
good example of this kind of practice.

The data from a study in Tabasco, Mexico (Gliessman
1978c) clearly show the temperature-modifying effects of
trees. In this study, the temperature microclimate of a treecovered cacao orchard was compared with that of a nearby
open grass pasture. As shown in Figure 5.8, temperature
changes over a 24 h period at various levels in the cacao plantation were much more moderate than they were at the same
levels in the pasture system. The pasture system became
warmer during the day than the cacao system, and became
colder aboveground during the night.


**Nonliving Canopies**
Other means of creating a canopy for a cropping system
are possible as well. Floating row covers of nylon fiber,
for example, have been used over organic strawberries in
California during the early winter season in an attempt to
allow more insolation of the soil surface below, yet provide
a localized greenhouse effect for reradiated heat given off

**FIGURE 5.8** **Temperature changes over a 24 h period at four different levels in an open pasture and in a tree-covered cacao plan-**
**tation in Tabasco, Mexico.** The presence of trees in the cacao system moderates temperature changes at all levels, keeps belowground
temperatures lower than those in open pasture, and keeps aboveground temperatures higher at night. A similar pattern is shown for relative humidity: in the pasture system, humidity fluctuates more over a 24 h period than it does in the cacao system. Note that the scales on
the vertical axes are not all identical. (Data from Gliessman, S.R., Unpublished research report, Colegio Superior de Agricultura Tropical,

from the soil surface. Figure 5.9 shows the results of one
study of this practice, in which temperatures in the upper
5 cm of the soil were significantly raised during the critical
root and crown development period for the strawberry plant
(Gliessman et al. 1996).

There has also been considerable research and practical experimentation in the use of “hoop houses” or plastic
tunnels for vegetable production in California, Spain, and
elsewhere (Illic 1989). Wire or plastic hoops are placed over
planted beds in the field, and then covered with plastic or
cloth. The localized greenhouse effect of these structures
traps and holds additional heat during the day, and the covering reduces heat loss during the night. Hoop houses can
allow for the earlier planting of warm-weather crops such as
tomatoes or peppers, or the extension of the cropping season into the fall or early winter where light frost becomes
possible. Due to their high cost, these structures are mostly
restricted to use with higher-value crops (Figure 5.10).


**Soil Surface Cover**

Changes in the soil temperature microclimate can be induced
by covering the surface of the soil. Growing a covercrop is
one well-recognized method of modifying soil temperature.



The covercrop shades the soil, hence lowering soil temperatures, and has additional positive impacts on soil organic
matter content, weed seed germination, and moisture conservation. When a covercrop is planted in-between active crop
plants, it is often called a living mulch. A living mulch can
change the albedo of the soil surface, making it less reflective and raising the temperature of the air immediately above
the crop. A living mulch can also have the opposite effect on
temperature by increasing evaporation off of the vegetation.

Nonliving mulches, of either organic or inorganic materials,
can change the temperature microclimate as well; their effect
depends on the color, texture, and thickness of the material.
Straw from crops such as wheat, oats, and barley is commonly
used for a dry mulch, as are many other kinds of crop residues
or grasses gathered from fallow fields, gardens, or nearby noncrop areas. Aquatic plants such as water hyacinth ( _Eichhornia_
_crassipes_ ) or duckweed ( _Lemna_ spp.), usually considered
a problem in waterways, especially in tropical areas, can be
pulled from the water and applied as mulch. Plant-derived
mulches eventually get incorporated into the soil, benefiting soil organic matter content. In recent times, some nonplant mulching materials have become popular; these include
newspaper, cardboard, cloth, and plastic sheeting. Specialized

**FIGURE 5.9** **Effect of floating row covers on soil temperature in an organic strawberry system.** When strawberries are grown under
conventional methods, it is possible to use clear plastic as a soil-temperature-elevating soil covering during the winter, because weeds have
been killed by prior soil fumigation. In organically grown strawberries, black plastic must be used instead to prevent weed growth. Black
plastic, however, is less efficient than clear plastic in raising the soil temperature, as shown in (a). In an attempt to compensate for this difference, nylon floating row covers were placed over the organic strawberries during the second year of the study. As shown in (b), the row
covers were successful in narrowing the soil temperature differences between the conventional and organic treatments during the period the
covers remained on the beds. (Data from Gliessman, S.R. et al., _Calif. Agric._, 50, 24, 1996.)



**FIGURE 5.10** **Hoop houses protecting frost-sensitive crops.**
The hoop house coverings, acting as a nonliving canopy, are put in
place at the end of the day to trap heat and reduce nighttime heat
loss; in the morning they are removed to allow light to reach the
crop. Frost is still visible on the ground just outside the shadow of
the center hoop house.


horticultural papers have been developed that biodegrade after
a period of time and can be worked back into the soil.

A practice with effects similar to those of adding a mulch
is to let a mulch accumulate naturally. This is accomplished
through the use of a no-till system. Crop residues are left on
the soil surface, forming a mulch that modifies the temperature of the soil and prevents moisture loss.

A final kind of practice is to change the color of the soil
surface to alter its albedo and thus the amount of solar energy
it absorbs. Burning crop residue is one way of doing this.
Residue burned to carbon black will absorb a greater amount
of heat, and residue burned to ash white will absorb less heat.



**Greenhouses and Shade Houses**

Shade houses and greenhouses are now common ways of
modifying the temperature environment at the microclimatic
level. Shade houses block a portion of incoming solar radiation, lowering solar gain and temperature.

Greenhouses, on the other hand, are more often used to
conserve or trap heat. Light energy penetrates the glass or
plastic cover on a greenhouse, and inside it is absorbed and
reradiated as long-wave heat energy. The reradiated energy
then becomes trapped inside the greenhouse. During extended
cold or cloudy periods, growers can heat the interiors of their
greenhouses from many different sources. Recirculating hot
water is often used to heat the floors of greenhouses, or at
least provide heat on benches in the houses for germination
or early plant development.

At certain times of the year or in particular climate zones,
excess heat can be trapped in a greenhouse, requiring venting and air cooling. Another way of reducing greenhouse
temperatures is to block some of the incoming solar radiation with shade cloth or other materials. Sophisticated greenhouse management now employs computer technology and
automation to achieve remarkable levels of microclimate

control (Figure 5.11).


**Methods of Preventing Frost Damage**
In more temperate regions of the world, especially at higher
elevations and latitudes, frost damage early or late in the
growing season may be a constant danger. Mulching and row
covers are important ways of providing some frost protection, but other means exist as well.

Raising soil moisture with irrigation when frost is
expected may help raise temperatures close to the ground
because evaporation of the moisture transfers heat from the
soil to the evaporated water vapor, which then surrounds the

The second challenge is to create production systems that
can withstand the rising temperatures, temperature extremes,
and unseasonal temperature anomalies that will increasingly
confront farmers over much of the world in the coming years.
The keywords in this effort are adaptation and resilience.
Adaptation involves an ability to change management strategies, crop types, seasonal timing, and agroecosystem design
in response to changes and anticipated changes in the temperature regime. Resilience comes from designing systems
that are inherently less vulnerable to temperature extremes
and variability, able to recover from damage, and diverse
enough to yield food no matter what kind of weather they are
subjected to.

Ultimately, these two challenges come together.
Agroecosystems that can survive climate change are also the
ones that do the least harm to the ecological foundations of
agriculture: they leverage diversity and natural processes and
they are designed and managed based on knowledge of the
environmental context—which includes very centrally the
factor of temperature.

season transplanting.


crop plants. The increased atmospheric moisture itself also
provides some protection for the plants.

In low-lying areas subject to cold air drainage at night,
farmers have long employed relatively simple means of
raising the temperature the few degrees necessary to avoid
frost damage. One technique is smudging, in which some
kind of fuel—such as diesel fuel, garbage, old tires, or plant
material—is burned to generate heat-trapping smoke or to
create enough air turbulence to keep cold air from settling
in depressions during a calm night. Recent concerns about
health hazards and air pollution have reduced the use of
smudging, however, and prompted farmers to use large fans
to keep the air moving in frost-prone areas. Obviously, such
techniques work only under certain conditions and when a
few degrees of temperature difference will matter.


**TEMPERATURE AND SUSTAINABILITY**


Designing and managing agroecosystems that are sustainable
with regard to the temperature factor involve two interrelated
challenges. The first challenge is to deal with the temperature
factor in ways that are not overly reliant on external inputs or
the use of fossil fuels, do not harm natural systems or diminish genetic diversity, and do not exacerbate inequality in the
social sphere. This aspect of sustainability puts limits on the
use of structures like shade houses, materials like plastic
sheeting, and devices like fans and shifts the focus to efforts
that provide microclimate modification as a feature of agroecosystems’ basic design. In this latter category are agroforestry systems that create a diversity of microclimates in their
interiors and work to moderate temperature extremes.



**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**


1. Describe several examples of farmers being able

to grow crops in an area subject to temperature
extremes greater than the normal tolerance levels
for the particular crop species. What is the ecological basis for success in such situations?

2. What are some examples of food crops you now

consume during a time of the year when temperature regimes in your local region would normally
not allow them to be grown?
3. How might climate change alter our patterns of food

production and consumption?
4. How is it possible to modify the microclimate to

extend the growing season for a crop? To allow
planting earlier in the season? To allow planting at a
higher elevation? To protect a crop from excessively
high temperatures?
