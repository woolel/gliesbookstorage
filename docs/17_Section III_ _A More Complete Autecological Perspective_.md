## _Section 3_ _A More Complete Autecological Perspective_

In the preceding chapters, we’ve restricted our attention to the ways in which individual factors of the environment affect individual crop plants. Although these interactions are the foundation of the autecological perspective, they do not make up the entire picture.

First, the environment surrounding a crop plant includes more than just physical factors like light, temperature, and moisture; it also comprises other organisms, which, like inadequate moisture or abundant sunlight, can inhibit or promote the crop plant’s growth or even kill it outright. Other organisms as factors of the environment—that is, as _biotic_ factors—are explored in Chapter 11.

Second, crop plants aren’t affected by each factor of the environment independently—the different factors, both

physical and biotic, interact with each other to create a whole environment that is dynamic and complex and cannot be reduced to its parts. Chapter 12 provides the basis for understanding how crop plants are affected by an environment understood in this way—as a complex of interacting factors.

Third, plants aren’t the only types of organisms in agroecosystems—either as the sources of the biomass harvested as food or as the biotic factors in the environment. Various

types of animals are raised for food, just as crop plants are, and both animals and other nonplants are often biotic factors of great concern to agroecosystem managers. Chapter 13 introduces the autecological roles these nonplants— collectively termed _heterotrophs_ —play in agroecosystems.
