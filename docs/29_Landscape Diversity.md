## 21. Landscape Diversity

Since the beginning of agriculture, humans have been altering and displacing naturally occurring terrestrial ecosystems across the face of the earth, largely for the purpose of creating agroecosystems. Not long ago in human history, when all agriculture was traditional and small scale, agroecosystems were interspersed as small patches across the larger natural landscape. Managed habitats maintained the integrity of natural ecosystems while diversifying the landscape. Today, in contrast, agricultural land uses predominate, making natural habitats the patches that are dispersed over much of the earth’s land surface. The ongoing process of converting land to agricultural production has had a dramatic and usually negative impact on the diversity of organisms and the integrity of ecological processes, and it has contributed significantly to climate change (Figure 21.1).

Although other forms of human exploitation of the environment, such as urbanization and mining, have also contributed to large-scale habitat modification and the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem function, agricultural production—including grazing and timber production— bears much of the responsibility for causing environmental changes at the biosphere scale that threaten the world’s life support systems.

One of the major goals of developing sustainable food systems is to reverse this legacy of destruction and neglect, to conserve biotic resources and protect environmental quality. Indeed, this goal is built into our definition of agricultural sustainability. More sustainable agroecosystems—more diverse, relying less on external inputs and intensive modification of the environment—will, by their very nature, be more environmentally friendly.

A variety of important design and management principles come to light when we focus on the relationships between agroecosystems, natural ecosystems, and the biosphere as a whole. In particular, we find that crops and farms can benefit as much as natural ecosystems when we design and manage agroecosystems with natural habitats, native species, and regional ecological processes in mind. We also find that when designing and managing agroecosystems in this way, they emit much less carbon than most food production systems do today and can even come close to sequestering as much carbon as intact natural systems.

Carrying out agricultural production so that it works with, rather than against, natural ecosystem processes is necessary not just for the sake of the natural environmental itself, but for the long-term welfare of human society. We depend on healthy, functioning ecosystems to moderate weather extremes, cycle nutrients, protect riverbanks from erosion,

filter our drinking water, detoxify our wastewater, generate new soil, pollinate crops, reduce the impacts of droughts and floods, sequester carbon, and provide us with a variety of other **ecosystem services** . By replacing most of the earth’s natural environments with systems managed for food, fiber, and timber production, we have seriously threatened the foundations of these ecosystem services. From a sustainability perspective, therefore, we must design and manage agroecosystems so that they (1) conserve remaining natural environments, ecosystems, and biodiversity, and (2) function as providers of ecosystem services themselves (Figure 21.1).

**AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE**

Developing agroecosystems that protect and enhance biotic diversity and ecological processes—and in turn derive benefits from the natural environment—requires a shift of perspective to the regional, or landscape level. So first we will examine the basic aspects of the agricultural landscape.

Agricultural development within a formerly natural environment tends to result in a heterogeneous mosaic of varying types of habitat patches spread across the landscape. The bulk of the land may be intensely managed and frequently disturbed for the purposes of agricultural production, but certain parts (wetlands, riparian corridors, hillocks) may be left in a relatively natural condition, and other parts (borders between fields, areas around buildings, roadsides, strips between fields and adjacent natural areas) may occasionally be disturbed but not intensely managed. In addition, natural ecosystems may surround or border areas in which agricultural production dominates (Figure 21.2).

Although the level of human influence on the land varies on a continuum from intense disturbance and management to relatively pristine wildness, we can divide this continuum into three sections to derive three basic kinds of components of the agricultural landscape:

1. _Areas of agricultural production_ . Intensely man aged and regularly disturbed, these areas are usually made up mainly of nonnative, domesticated plant species. 2. _Areas of moderate or reduced human influence_ .

This intermediate category includes pasture land, forests managed for timber production, hedgerows and other border areas, and agroforestry systems. These areas are typically made up of some mixture of native and nonnative plant species and are able to serve as habitat for many native animal species.

Other types of natural ecosystems, including woodlands, scrublands, and grasslands, have experienced similar contraction, and these trends are likely to continue.

**L** **andscape** **P** **atterns**

Within the landscape mosaic, there are three common, recognizable patterns in how the three components are arranged in relation to each other: (1) a natural area and an area managed for agricultural production are separated by an area of moderate or reduced human influence; (2) natural areas form strips, corridors, or patches within an area of agricultural production; and (3) areas of moderate or reduced human influence are dispersed within an area of agricultural production. These three patterns, illustrated in Figure 21.3, can be combined and arranged in many different ways.

An important variable in the mosaic patterning of the agricultural landscape is its degree of heterogeneity or diversity. Landscapes are relatively homogenous when areas of agricultural production predominate, unbroken by patches

**FIGURE 21.2** **A diverse agricultural landscape near Nanjing,** **China.** Natural ecosystems interface with a variety of human landuse activities in an agricultural setting.

3. _Natural areas_ . These areas retain some resem

blance of the original ecosystem structure and species composition naturally present in the location, although they may be small in size, contain some nonnative species, and be subject to some human disturbance.

These three landscape components, in various combinations and arrangements, form the mosaic pattern of the typical agricultural landscape.

**FIGURE 21.3** **Examples of three common patterns in the** **arrangement of the components of the agricultural landscape.** A natural ecosystem and an agroecosystem can be separated by an area of intermediate human influence (a); a natural ecosystem can form a corridor, strip, or patch within an agroecosystem (b); and areas of less intense human management can be dispersed within a larger area of agricultural production (c).

Landscape Diversity **267**

or strips of the other two kinds of landscape components. Heterogeneous landscapes, in contrast, have an abundance of noncrop and natural patches.

The heterogeneity of the agricultural landscape varies greatly by region. In some parts of the world (e.g., the Midwestern United States), the heavy use of agricultural chemicals, herbicides, mechanical technology, narrow genetic lines, and irrigation over large areas has made the landscape relatively homogenous. In such areas, the agricultural landscape is made up mostly of large areas of single-crop agricultural production. In other areas (e.g., the Jiangsu Province of the Yangtze in China or many shadegrown coffee regions of Central America and Mexico), the use of traditional farming practices with minimal industrial inputs has resulted in a varied, highly heterogeneous landscape—possibly even more heterogeneous than would exist naturally.

The typical agricultural landscape, because of its mosaic makeup, is ecologically a fragmented environment. Each patch is a fragment isolated from other similar patches by some other type of ecologically dissimilar community. On the one hand, this fragmentation can have negative effects on populations restricted to a particular type of habitat. On the other hand, a fragmented, heterogeneous landscape has high gamma diversity. As we will explore in the next section, effective management at the level of the landscape involves enhancing gamma diversity and taking advantage of its benefits, while at the same time mitigating the possible negative consequences of habitat fragmentation.

At the landscape level, the movement of organisms and substances between habitat patches becomes a critical factor in the maintenance of overall ecological processes. Also important is the interaction of organisms and physical processes located in different habitat patches. What happens in one area of the landscape can have an impact on other areas.

The study of these factors, and how they are shaped by the spatial patterning of the landscape, is known as **landscape** **ecology** . Because it helps us understand how the different parts of the landscape mosaic are formed and how they interact, landscape ecology provides a good basis for management of the agricultural landscape (Turner et al. 2001; Odum and Barrett 2005).

Three important tools of landscape ecology are aerial photography, satellite imagery, and geographic information system (GIS) analysis. Using these tools, present landscape patterns can be contrasted with those that were observed in the past. The changes that have occurred can then be correlated with farming systems data to understand the role of agroecosystems in maintaining the stability and sustainability of landscape systems, which provides a basis for designing management schemes that take into account all landscape elements (Ellis 2011).

Any form of historical data on landscape patterns can be useful in analyzing the agricultural landscape. Census data, such as that from the US Census of Agriculture, can be particularly important in determining the types of crops that have been grown in a region and where they were grown. These data can be given quantifiable values when combined with aerial photographs, allowing the analyst to determine the number of landscape elements present at different times (e.g., crop fields, pastures, riparian corridors, forest patches). When these data are subjected to GIS analysis, they can become a dynamic way of visualizing the patterns and relationships of landscape structure through time.

For example, the GIS images in Figure 21.4 show changes that have occurred over several decades in an agricultural region of Guangdong Province in China. As this region underwent a shift from a primarily agricultural economy to a more industrialized economy, agricultural land underwent significant change. Through a combination of forest recovery, planted forestry, and the development of orchard crops, woody vegetation recovered, and in many formerly agricultural lands, built structures increased. As the images

**268** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

in Figure 21.4 indicate, multiple layers of data that vary in content and time can be integrated to understand the drivers and consequences of changes such as these.

Knowledge of the farming practices that have been used in the past in any particular landscape, combined with knowledge of how different components of the landscape interact, makes it possible to understand how farming practices impact the nonfarm elements of a landscape, and vice versa. Soil erosion rates, fertilizer inputs, pesticide applications, irrigation, crop types and diversity, and other practices and processes can be understood in terms of landscape patterns. Based on this knowledge, recommendations for change in either cropping patterns or farming practices can be made, and decisions on agroecosystem design can move beyond the farm and into the larger landscape context.

**MANAGEMENT AT THE LEVEL**

**OF THE LANDSCAPE**

When agroecosystem management is carried out at the level of the larger agricultural landscape, the antagonism that so often exists between the interests of natural ecosystems and those of managed production systems can be replaced by a relationship of mutual benefit. Natural and seminatural ecosystem patches included in the landscape can become a resource for agroecosystems, and agroecosystems can begin to assume a positive rather than negative role in preserving the integrity of natural ecosystems.

The concept of landscape-level management does not necessarily mean coordinated management among the many different stakeholders in an agricultural area (different farmers, governmental agencies, conservation interests, etc.). Its essence is the inclusion of natural ecosystems and local biodiversity in management decisions and land-use planning. Thus, landscape-level management can be implemented by an individual farmer who has direct control over only a small part of the agricultural landscape of a region.

The implementation of landscape-level management has two guiding principles:

1. Diversify the agricultural landscape by increasing

the density, size, abundance, and variety of noncrop habitat patches, and by creating more connections between them. These patches can vary in their level of disturbance and “naturalness”; what they share in common is the ability to be sites where natural ecological processes can occur and where native or beneficial plant and animal species can find suitable habitat.

2. Manage cropping areas to reduce their negative

impacts on the natural environment and maximize their value as habitat for native species. This means eliminating or reducing the use of pesticides, inorganic fertilizer, and irrigation, and finding alternatives to farming practices that interfere with ecosystem processes, such as frequent tilling,

leaving fields without soil cover for long periods, planting large-scale monocultures, and mowing or spraying roadsides and ditches.

The latter principle goes hand in hand with everything discussed in this text up to this point. Reducing nonfarm inputs, relying on biological controls, diversifying cropping systems, and allowing successional processes to proceed further all these practices contribute to creating more environmentally friendly agroecosystems. Assuming this agroecologically based management, we will focus first on the first principle— diversifying the agricultural landscape—and then later in the section explore the ways that the alternative management described in the second principle can enhance the ability of the landscape to provide environmental services.

The noncrop habitat patches in a diverse agricultural landscape can interact with areas of agricultural production in a variety of ways. An area of noncrop habitat adjacent to a crop field, for example, can harbor populations of a native parasitic wasp species that can move into the field and parasitize a pest; it can also serve as a source of soil microorganisms for recolonization of agricultural lands after practices antagonistic to their presence are halted. A riparian corridor vegetated by native plant species provides an example of a more complex relationship: the corridor can filter out dissolved fertilizer nutrients leaching from crop fields, promote the presence of beneficial species, and allow the movement of native animal species into and through the agricultural components of the landscape.

As can be seen in these examples, landscape-level diversification offers benefits to both native species and agroecosystems. When diversification is carefully planned and managed, these benefits can be maximized, and the possible negative effects minimized. Effective landscapelevel management is thus an important part of achieving sustainability.

The farmer can actively encourage and maintain the presence of native species on the intensively managed areas of the farm by establishing and protecting appropriate habitats (Jackson and Jackson 2002; Pisani Gareau et al. 2013). These habitats can be within the farm fields, between fields, along roadways, in ditches, along property lines, or at the boundary separating farm fields from housing areas. The habitats can be permanent strips or blocks planted to diverse noncrop perennials, or temporary patches within the farm fields. Methods of creating such habitats include the following:

- Plant a covercrop that grows during the winter

months. The crop may provide critical food or cover for a range of animal species, especially groundnesting birds.

- Leave strips of unharvested crops such as corn or

wheat; these can provide resources for native animal species.

**CASE STUDY: LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY IN TLAXCALA, MEXICO**

In Tlaxcala, Mexico, rain comes in periodic heavy bursts capable of causing severe erosion. In addition, many local farmers must grow their food on steep, erosion-prone slopes. To deal with this situation, they cultivate hillside terrace systems that not only prevent soil erosion, but also effectively conserve rainfall–runoff and provide the basis for exceptional landscape diversity. These systems, which make use of water- and sediment-trapping catchment basins called _cajetes_, have enabled traditional farmers in this region to maintain the integrity and fertility of the soil for centuries without relying on imported, commercially produced inputs such as fertilizers (Mountjoy and Gliessman 1988).

The high degree of landscape diversity in the Tlaxcala terrace systems comes from having a large amount of permanent border space between cultivated terraces covered in natural vegetation. The border areas occupy the edges of the terraces, above and below the _cajetes_ . They are vegetated with a highly diverse mixture of perennials, trees, and weeds, achieved by allowing natural succession to occur. The plants in the borders help cycle nutrients, prevent erosion, and provide habitat for beneficial organisms. Wild relatives of the crop plants often flourish in the border areas also, providing a potential source of gene flow that may help the crops maintain their hardiness and resistance.

Because the terraces are long and narrow, no crop plant is ever more than 6.5 m from a field border. Approximately 30% of the farming landscape is made up of border vegetation, while at any one time about 60% or less of the land is being farmed and 10% or more left fallow. By all measures, these hillside systems are very diverse, and designed to take full advantage of all that landscape-level diversity has to offer (Figure 21.5).

**FIGURE 21.5** **Borders of native perennials and trees alongside cultivated terraces in, Tlaxcala, Mexico.** Strips of mostly natural vegetation are prominent and ecologically important components of the agricultural landscape in this hilly farming region. Note the animals grazing the border edge and cornstalks stacked for future use as feed.

- Where erosion control is necessary on a farm, plant

grassed waterways to enhance diversity and achieve important environmental protection goals.

- On terraced hillsides, plant perennial grasses or

shrubs on the walls separating the terraces.

- Plant perennials on land that is marginal or suscep tible to erosion, or restore this land to a more natural state by allowing natural succession of native species.

- Restore poorly drained or semipermanent wetland

sites on the farm to natural wetlands.

- Retain or plant native trees in and around fields as

nesting, perch, and hunting sites for native birds.

- Provide artificial perches for native raptors, and

bird boxes for other potentially beneficial bird species.

In a highly modified agricultural landscape where very little if any of the natural habitat is left, all of these kinds of measures can be important for restoring the landscape’s biodiversity and its ability to provide ecosystem services.

Where relatively extensive nonfarmed natural ecosystems exist around and within the agricultural landscape, the shared boundary, or interface, between these areas and those managed for agricultural production takes on important ecological significance. This is especially true in regions where considerable topographic, geologic, and microclimatic variability existed before agricultural conversion. Depending on management history, these borders and edges can be abrupt and sharply defined or broad and ill defined. When there is a gradual transition between a crop area and natural vegetation (as occurs, e.g., between a shade-tree-covered cacao plantation and the surrounding natural forest), an **ecotone** is created. Such transitional zones are often recognized as distinct habitats of their own, able to support unique mixtures of species. In many situations they are made up of successional species from both the natural ecosystem and the manipulated

agroecosystem.

**Creating Benefits for the Agroecosystem** Edges that are ecotonal in nature, even if they are relatively narrow, can play important roles in an agricultural landscape. Since the environmental conditions existing within the edge are transitional between the farm habitat and the natural habi tat, species from both can occur there together, along with other species that actually prefer the intermediate conditions. Very often the variety and density of life is greatest in the habitat of the edge or ecotone, a phenomenon that has been called the **edge effect** . Edge effect is influenced by the amount of edge available, with length, width, and degree of contrast between adjoining habitats all being determining factors.

Benefits of the edge habitat for cropping systems are becoming more well known. In a thorough review of the topic of the influence of adjacent habitats on insect populations in crop fields, Altieri and Nicholls (2004b) suggest that edges are important habitats for the propagation and protection of a wide range of natural biological control agents of agricultural pest organisms. Some beneficial organisms are not attracted to or able to survive long in the disturbed environment of the crop field, especially those where pesticides are applied; they choose instead to move back and forth from the edge to the farm fields, using the fields mainly for feeding or egg laying. Other beneficials depend on alternate hosts in the edge system to survive times when the agricultural fields do not have populations of their primary host, such as during a dry season or when the crop is not present. The habitat value of edges extends belowground into the soil environment; because the soil of the edge area is less disturbed, it may serve as a refuge for valuable soil biota. As we learn more about the conditions

needed in edge areas to ensure diverse and effective populations of beneficial organisms, actual management of these transitional areas can become part of the landscape management process (Figure 21.6).

The management of edges will depend in part on determining their appropriate spatial relationship with farmed

**FIGURE 21.6** **A second-growth edge habitat at Finca Loma** **Linda, Coto Brus, Costa Rica.** Low, diverse vegetation at the forest edge can serve as habitat for beneficial organisms who, once established there, can move out into the crops.

areas. What is the ideal proportion of edge habitat area to crop area? How close to the edge habitat does a crop plant need to be for it to benefit from edge-dependent beneficials? Can intermediate habitats such as flowering plant corridors effectively extend edges into a crop area? Such issues will need to be addressed to optimize benefits for the agroecosystem and to enhance regional biodiversity.

**Protecting Adjacent Natural Ecosystems** If we shift our perspective to the health of the natural ecosystems on the other side of the edge from the farm fields, the edge can be seen to function as a **buffer zone** that protects the natural system from the potential negative impacts of farming, forestry, or grazing. As a buffer, the edge modifies the wind flow, moisture levels, temperature, and solar radiation characteristic of the farm field so that these environmental conditions do not have as great an impact on the adjacent natural ecosystem (Laurance et al. 2002). This modification is especially important for species that live in the understory of forest vegetation; an abrupt edge might allow wind, heat, and stronger light to penetrate into the forest and disrupt species composition.

Buffer zones can serve other important roles as well. For example, they can prevent fire from moving from the open habitat of the cropping system into the natural ecosystem. Such protection is especially important in areas where fire is used to burn slash left from shifting cultivation practices.

Studies on the central coast of California have demon strated how buffer zones can effectively mitigate the impacts of agriculture on the adjacent natural environment (Los Huertos 1999; Rein et al. 2007). At and around the study site, hills with highly erosion- and leaching-prone soils slope down to fingers of a wetland estuary. Strawberries are typically planted right down to the edge of the wetland. Erosion rates in excess of 150 tons/ha of soil occur in wet years. In addition, nitrates are leached into the estuary by rainfall and irrigation water, and phosphates and pesticide residues

**FIGURE 21.7** **A native perennial grass buffer strip between strawberry fields and a wetland estuary, Elkhorn Slough, CA.** When strawberries are planted to the edge of the estuary (a), the estuary is impacted by erosion and leaching.

that are adhered to eroded soil particles move into the estuary as well, contributing to the degradation of the wetland ecosystem (Soil Conservation Service 1984). In an attempt to prevent these negative impacts, a buffer zone was planted between the intensively farmed strawberry fields and the estuary. Because coastal grass and scrubland occupied the farmed sites originally, native perennial grasses were planted in dense strips varying from 20 to 50 m wide. Once established, the grass cover effectively trapped sediments and took up soluble nutrients, limiting both erosion and the flow of nitrates, phosphates, and pesticides into the estuary. The buffer zone also served as a potential reservoir of beneficial insects for the farm fields (Figure 21.7).

Buffer zones have become very important parts of ecologically based development (ecodevelopment) projects in many parts of the rural world (Bennett and Mulongoy 2006). In regions where forests are being encroached upon by farming and grazing systems that replace the natural ecosystems with agricultural activities, buffer zones can protect the forest from further incursions yet provide an area where human activities can occur. Traditional land-use activities, including nonextractive forestry, understory cropping, agroforestry, and collection of native plant or animal material, are permitted in the buffer zone as long as the structure of the forest in the buffer is retained and the adjacent forest is protected. In an ideal situation, the forest ecosystem is preserved, limited economic activity goes on in the buffer, and intensive agricultural activities take place in adjacent cleared areas. The success of such programs has been limited due to a range of social, economic, and political reasons (Naughton-Treves

and Salafsky 2004; Mehring and Stoll-Kleemann 2011), but the concept holds promise as an important way of integrating the goals of sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation.

**T** **he** **E** **cology** **of** **P** **atchiness**

The patchiness of the agricultural landscape has a profound influence on the ecological processes occurring throughout the landscape. Similar habitat patches are isolated from each other, yet gamma diversity is potentially high. In such a context, the size and shape of patches, and the distance between them, are important factors determining biodiversity at the landscape level.

When highly modified agricultural lands separate natural ecosystem patches, the patches are ecologically analogous to islands. Following the theory of island biogeography presented in Chapter 17, agricultural “oceans” can block or selectively block—that is, _filter_ —the movement of different plant and animal species between the natural islands. Thus, a population of a particular species existing in one patch may be isolated from other populations; unless frequent interchange of individuals can occur between patches, each subpopulation can become subject to either genetic isolation or extirpation.

Because natural ecosystem patches provide refugia for agriculturally beneficial organisms and can provide various other environmental services, there is considerable advantage in determining the optimum density, abundance, and configuration of natural ecosystem patches in relation to areas

**272** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

of agricultural production. Corridors linking habitat patches may be necessary for facilitating movement of beneficial organisms across the landscape. A certain width of edge may provide the optimal edge effect without creating pest problems for both natural and agricultural systems. Promoters of integrated pest management often claim that successful pest management without the use of pesticides will require regional- or landscape-level management programs that strive to take advantage of both the isolating mechanisms and facilitating mechanisms of a patchy environment (Collinge 2009). Ecologists are being called upon to apply their knowledge of ecological processes in natural ecosystems to solving such problems (Kareiva and Marvier 2011).

When the agricultural landscape is viewed as an integrated whole, combining all of the nonfarmed and farmed areas in a region, it can be managed so that it functions as an integrated ecosystem and provides environmental services in much the same way that natural ecosystems would provide alone. The agroecological knowledge and practices described in Sections III and IV of this book provide much of the theoretical and practical basis of this management.

Environmental services are the many “goods” and services provided by natural ecosystems that are essential for human survival and welfare and the global biosphere (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2003; Wratten et al. 2013). Until recently, we have tended to take them for granted because they are perceived as free and abundant. Ecosystem services that are particularly important for sustainable agroecosystem function include nutrient cycling, biological control of pests and diseases, erosion control and sediment retention, water regulation, and maintenance of the genetic diversity essential for successful crop and animal breeding. Outside of the direct agroecosystem context, ecosystem services are important at a global scale. They regulate the gaseous composition of the atmosphere (especially through sequestration of CO 2 ), create and maintain biodiversity, affect climate and weather, and maintain watershed function. Table 21.1 provides a list of ecosystem services important in an agroecosystem context, each paired with the ecological processes responsible for it.

A natural ecosystem provides ecosystem services when its biochemical, biophysical, and biological processes are functioning in a healthy manner, allowing it to be biologically productive (Swift et al. 2004). The same principle holds for agroecosystems. If an agroecosystem is to be a provider of ecosystem services it must be designed and managed so that its diversity, stability, and complexity approach that of a natural ecosystem. In other words, increasing agroecosystem diversity (Chapter 17) and allowing greater successional development (Chapter 18) are the bases for creating an agricultural landscape that can attain its potential for full ecosystem function.

Diversification of agroecosystems, as we know, comes about through multiple cropping, rotations, fallows, mulching,

minimum tillage, and livestock integration, and successional development can be achieved through agroforestry, more extensive use of perennials, and the creation of successional mosaics. And when diverse, successionally developed agroecosystems are managed in concert with the noncrop components of the landscape through the practices discussed earlier in this chapter, the ecological processes of nutrient cycling, population regulation, and energy exchange are integrated across the whole landscape, ensuring the robust functioning from which ecosystem services arise.

When we use ecologically based management practices to enhance the ability of agroecosystems to provide ecosystem services, we are clearly working toward the goal of agricultural sustainability at the same time. But it is only when we expand our thinking to the landscape level that sustainability and ecosystem services converge with the conservation of biodiversity (Swift et al. 2004; Scherr 2007; Perfecto et al. 2009; Wratten et al. 2013).

**L** **andscape** **M** **ultifunctionality**

When a landscape is made up of patches of relatively natural systems and agroecosystems that are managed both to produce food and to enhance and protect biodiversity, it can be considered a **multifunctional landscape** . This integrative

Landscape Diversity **273**

concept—the logical result of extending the agroecological principle of diversity to the landscape level—recognizes the critical value of biodiversity and ecosystem services and acknowledges that humans have already permanently altered much of the face of the earth.

From the standpoint of sustainability, landscape multifunctionality cannot be limited to rural and agricultural landscapes. The basic principle of integrating human uses of land with the needs of natural systems and nonhuman organisms so that mutual benefit is maximized must be extended to all anthropogenic landscapes, including urbanized areas. It is not enough to focus on the sustainability of agricultural production in its relationship to natural systems; we must also include the land dedicated to the most intensive human

uses—habitation, transportation, energy production, and manufacturing—and be concerned about its interface and connections with the agricultural landscape. If a major reason for the lack of sustainability in our current food system is the extreme spatial separation of the consumers of food and the land on which their food is produced, then a more sustainable system needs to focus on the spatial layout of the human presence on the earth and its relationship to food production. The implications of this broader consideration of landscape multifunctionality will be discussed in the final chapter.

**AGRICULTURE, LAND USE,**

**AND SUSTAINABILITY**

As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, agricultural development has fundamentally changed the relationship between human culture and the natural environment. More

than 50% of the earth’s terrestrial surface is now devoted

to agriculture (cropland and pasture), making agriculture the primary agent of anthropogenic change and biodiversity loss on the planet. But while agriculture bears much of the responsibility for endangering the integrity of the planet’s life-support systems, it is also positioned to be the focal point for efforts to protect those very systems and to mitigate the effects of other human activities (such as fossil-fuel use) on biosphere-level processes. The central role of agriculture in shaping humankind’s impact on the biosphere is a result of both the large proportion of land under some kind of agricultural management and the fact that agriculturalists are the actors responsible for managing this land (Lovell et al. 2010). On their actions hinge the possibility not only of a sustainable food system, but also of a sustainable human presence on the planet.

On an earth with a cultural landscape, efforts to preserve our remaining biodiversity and the ecosystem services provided by ecological processes can no longer be focused primarily on the small areas of land that are still wild (Perfecto et al. 2009). Managed lands, particularly those that are agricultural, have an enormous untapped potential for supporting a diversity of native species and providing ecosystem services, thus contributing to conservation of global biodiversity and ensuring that nutrient cycling, pollination, water purification, and other essential processes still

operate. This chapter has discussed many of the ways in which agricultural landscapes can be managed so as to further these goals. It has not delved into two closely related, broader topics that figure critically in sustainability: (1) the role that agriculture can play in mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration and (2) the geographic and land-use facets of building a food system that is far more sustainable and ecosystem friendly than what exists today, which we mentioned earlier in the context of landscape multifunctionality. These topics will be touched on briefly in Chapter 26.

Ultimately, the solutions to even these broader issues rest on the foundation provided by the core agroecological principle of working in concert with, rather than in opposition to, the ecological processes in nature. By managing anthropogenic landscapes from the point of view of biodiversity conservation as well as food production, all organisms can benefit in the long term, including humans. Learning how to manage in this way will require wise application of agroecological principles, as well as collaboration between conservation biologists, agricultural researchers, farmers, rural sociologists, land-use planners, urban planners, and others, and new directions in research.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. What are some of the possible ways that organisms

typical of natural ecosystems can contribute to the sustainability of agroecosystems? 2. What principal changes must occur in the way

present-day conventional agroecosystems are managed in order for them to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity as well as to satisfy human needs for food production? 3. Why is the biodiversity of smaller, less obvious

organisms in ecosystems, such as fungi and insects, of potentially greater importance to sustainability than that of the larger, more obvious mammals and birds?

4. Why are the small-scale, integrated farming sys tems of traditional farmers in a better position to provide important ecosystem services than largescale conventional systems? 5. What kind of criteria should be used to determine

which species in the agricultural landscape are the most important to preserve and enhance? 6. How is the landscape perspective important in sus tainable agriculture management?
