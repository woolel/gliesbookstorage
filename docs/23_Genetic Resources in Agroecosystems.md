## chapter 15. Genetic Resources in Agroecosystems

Agriculture came about as early human cultures intensified their use and care of particular plants and animals that they found to be of value. During this process, humans inadvertently selected for specific traits and qualities in these useful organisms, altering their genetic makeup over time. Their ability to produce edible or useful biomass was enhanced, but their ability to survive without human intervention was reduced. Humans came to depend on these domesticated species for food, feed, and fiber, and most of them became dependent on us. This interdependence between humans and domesticated species is the essence of agriculture, and it was made possible by the indirect manipulation of organisms’

genomes.

Throughout most of human history, humans manipulated the genetic makeup of crops and livestock without explicit knowledge of genetics. Farmers simply made the choice to plant seed or breed animals from the individuals or populations that demonstrated the most desirable characteristics, and this was enough to direct the evolution of domesticated species. Gradually, plant and animal breeding developed into a science as we learned more about the genetic basis of selection and began to direct it more specifically to our advantage. Today, the fields of biotechnology and genetic engineering are rapidly expanding the power that humans have over the genomes of domesticated species, making it possible to incorporate traits and characteristics into plants and animals in ways and at rates never before possible.

From the viewpoint of sustainability, however, the directions of crop and livestock breeding efforts of the past several decades—and the directions proposed for the future—are cause for deep concern. The genetic base of agriculture has narrowed to a dangerous point as human societies have become increasingly dependent on a few species of foodproducing organisms and on a smaller number of the genes and genetic combinations found in those species. Crop plants have lost much of the genetic basis of their pest and disease resistance and their ability to tolerate adverse environmental conditions, leading to crop failures and increased dependence on human-derived inputs and technologies for the maintenance of optimum growth conditions. In addition, genetic resources beyond the crops themselves—wild crop relatives, weedy derivatives, and traditional cultivated varieties, genetic lines, and breeding stocks—have been greatly reduced.

The relationship between genetics and agriculture is a vast topic. This chapter explores a small part of it, focusing on the foundations needed for understanding the role of genetic diversity in moving toward sustainability in agriculture.

We examine genetic change in nature and how it results in genetic diversity, outline the processes humans use to direct and manipulate genetic change in domesticated species (with a focus on crop plants), look at the ways in which agriculture is systematically reducing agrobiodiversity, and discuss how agrobiodiversity can be preserved through appropriate management of genetic resources.

**GENETIC CHANGE IN NATURE AND THE**

**PRODUCTION OF GENETIC DIVERSITY**

From the perspective of geologic time, the earth’s flora and fauna are constantly changing. The physical and behavioral characteristics of species change, new species appear, and other species go extinct. This change, called evolution, is made possible by the manner in which traits are passed from parent to offspring and are driven by changes in environmental conditions. As ice ages come and go, continents move, and mountains emerge and erode, living things respond. Through natural selection, the changing and varied environment acts on species’ genomes, causing them to change— imperceptibly from generation to generation, but often dramatically when the changes accumulate over thousands and millions of years.

Natural selection has created the genetic diversity found in nature, the raw material that humans have worked with in domesticating plants and animals and creating agroecosystems. It is therefore important to understand how natural selection works and how it applies to human-directed genetic change and the maintenance of our agricultural genetic

resources.

**A** **daptation**

The concept of **adaptation** is a basis for understanding natural selection because it relates the environment to a species’ traits. The term refers both to a process and a characteristic resulting from that process. In static terms, an adaptation is any aspect of an organism or its parts that is of value in allowing the organism to withstand conditions of the environment and reproduce. An adaptation may

- Enable an organism to better use resources;

- Provide protection from environmental stresses and

pressures;

- Modify local environments to the benefit of the

organism;

- Facilitate reproduction.

Any organism existing in nature must have a great many adaptations in order for it to survive; in theory, nearly all an organism’s behaviors and physical characteristics are adaptations. Another way of saying this is that at any point in time a naturally existing organism as a whole is always _adapted_ to its environment.

The adaptations possessed by a particular species, however, do not necessarily remain the same over long periods of time, because the environment is always changing and organisms are continuously adapting. The process by which adaptations change over time is also called adaptation, and is understood in terms of natural selection.

Individual members of sexually reproducing species are not identical to each other. The variation that exists among humans is mirrored in other species, even though we may not always be able to discern it. This natural variability exists both at the level of the **genotype** —the genetic information carried by an individual—and at the level of the **phenotype** —the physical and behavioral expression of the

genotype.

An examination of a number of individuals of any population quickly demonstrates the existence of phenotypic variability (Figure 15.2). Any characteristic, from number of leaves on a plant to the length of the tail of an animal, shows a range of variability. An average value or mode for each characteristic occurs, and if variation in each trait were graphed as a frequency distribution, it would tend to follow a normal curve of probability (a bell-shaped curve). Some populations show a very narrow range of variation, while others show much more. Although phenotypic variation does not correlate directly with genotypic variation, it usually has a significant genotypic basis.

The genetic variability within a species is due mainly to the nature of DNA replication: DNA does not always replicate itself perfectly; errors of different types, called mutations,

always occur at some frequency. Since DNA replication is a prerequisite to reproduction, new individuals are constantly coming into existence with mutations. Although some mutations are fatal, some detrimental, some neutral, and only a few advantageous, all mutations represent genetic difference and thus genetic variability. Most mutations are simply single changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA molecules; by themselves they may have no significant effect, but added together over time they can result in fundamental changes, such as bigger fruit, resistance to frost, or the addition of tendrils for climbing.

Variability is also produced by sexual reproduction. When two individuals reproduce sexually, the genes of each are distributed differently into different gametes (sex cells), and the genetic material carried in the gametes is mixed in novel ways when the gametes combine during fertilization. Variation is also introduced during meiosis (the formation of gametes) when chromosomes are deleted or translocated, or when homologous chromosomes fail to separate at the first meiotic division.

This latter kind of “error” creates gametes that have two copies of each chromosome (diploid) instead of the usual one (haploid). If one of these diploid gametes fuses with a normal haploid gamete a zygote with three times the haploid number of chromosomes can result, and when one fuses with another unreduced diploid gamete a zygote with four times the haploid number can be formed. Such increases in the number of chromosomes represent another source of genetic variety, particularly important in plants. Plants with more than the diploid number of chromosomes, called **polyploid**, typically have different characteristics than their diploid forebears, and occur relatively commonly in nature.

Because of natural genetic variation, some individuals of a population will have traits not possessed by others, or will express a certain trait to a greater or lesser degree than others. These traits may give the individuals who possess them certain advantages in living. These individuals may

grow more rapidly, survive in greater numbers, or have some reproductive advantage. Due to such factors, they may leave more offspring than other individuals, thus increasing the representation of their genetic material in the population as a whole. It is through such a process of differential reproductive success that a species undergoes genetic change over time.

The direction and manner of this change is determined by **natural selection** —the process by which environmental conditions determine which traits confer an advantage and therefore increase in frequency in the population. If the environment in which a population lived was totally optimal and never changed, genetic change would occur, but there would be no natural selection to direct it. However, since environmental conditions are always changing and never optimal for very long, natural selection is always occurring at some level. In addition to long-term changes in factors such as climate, natural selection is driven by such environmental changes as population growth of other species, the appearance of new species through migration, the evolution of predators and herbivores, and changes in microhabitats due to erosion, sedimentation, succession, and other processes.

Natural selection acts on populations, not whole species. If a population of a species becomes reproductively isolated from the rest of the species—that is, if physical barriers prevent its members from interbreeding with members of other populations—that population can undergo genetic change in a unique way. Because the environment is never homogenous over space and time, the isolated population will be subjected to somewhat different selective pressures than other populations of the species. The tendency, therefore, is for different populations to evolve somewhat differently if they are isolated genetically. Biogeographically, the species becomes a mosaic of populations, each of which has unique genetically based physiological and morphological characteristics. Each distinct population is referred to as an **ecotype** . Through evolutionary time, an ecotype can become distinct enough from other ecotypes of the species that it becomes a distinct species in its own right.

The evolutionary processes that cause the development of ecotypes and drive speciation are constantly diversifying the genetic basis of earth’s biota. Although species go extinct, new species are always evolving, and the genomes of many existing species are becoming more varied over time. One of our great fears today, however, is that human activity, including agriculture, is fundamentally altering this process. Our destruction, alteration, and simplification of natural habitats has greatly increased rates of extinction and eliminated ecotypes, thus eroding natural genetic diversity and the potential for its renewal (Wilson 2002).

**DIRECTED SELECTION AND DOMESTICATION**

Genetic change in an agricultural context differs greatly from genetic change in naturally occurring populations. Humans construct and manipulate the environments in which agricultural species live, grow, and reproduce, thereby creating an

entirely different set of selective pressures for them. Humans determine which traits are most desirable, and select for these traits in the way they cultivate and propagate the species. Because humans “direct” genetic change in agricultural populations, the process by which this genetic change occurs is called **directed selection** .

Today’s agricultural species—both plants and animals— were domesticated by gradually shifting their context from natural systems dominated by natural selection to humancontrolled systems in which directed selection operated. Some 10,000–12,000 years ago, humans did not create strictly controlled agricultural environments like farmers do today. In the case of plants, they cared for certain naturally occurring species by modifying their habitats, facilitating their reproduction, controlling their competitors, and occasionally moving them to more convenient places. In the case of animals, they followed herds of herbivores more closely, began to protect them from predators, and often provided them with feed. Natural selection still had an important role in such systems, because the human intervention was not sufficient to overcome the fact that the useful species still had to survive the rigors of the natural environment.

The process of **domestication** began as humans became better able to alter and control the environment in which use ful plants and animals occurred, and to manage the reproduction of these species to such an extent that they began to unintentionally select for specific useful traits. As domestication progressed, selection became more intentional, with early agriculturalists choosing seed from the plants with higher and more predictable yields, and early pastoralists choosing, for example, to breed the goats that produced the most milk. Throughout the process of domestication, the screening effect of the natural environment became less important and directed selection took on a greater role. Eventually, crop and livestock species reached a point where their genetic makeup had been altered to such an extent that they could no longer survive outside of an agroecosystem.

A domesticated species is dependent on human intervention, and the human species is now dependent on domesticated plants and animals. In ecological terms, this interdependency can be considered an obligate mutualism. It has come about through a process of mutual change: human cultures have both caused changes in the genetic makeup of certain useful species and been transformed themselves as a result of those changes.

Today’s crop plants and stock animals have been subjected to many selection pressures over thousands of years. In plants, humans have selected for optimized yield, appealing taste and appearance, and ease of harvest, and more recently for fast response to fertilizer and water application, ease of processing, resistance to shipping damage, longer shelf life, and genetic uniformity. In animals, we have selected for docility, more easily manageable reproductive cycles, and

**SPECIAL TOPIC: ORIGINS OF AGRICULTURE**

Between 10,000 and 4,000 years ago, agriculture arose independently in several different areas of the world, each with its own geography, climate, and indigenous flora and fauna. Six widely recognized centers of early agricultural development are shown on the map in Figure 15.3. The center in China is sometimes divided into two subcenters, the Yangtze River Valley in the south and the Yellow River Valley in the north. The Southeast Asia and South Pacific “center” is diffuse, spreading over a somewhat larger area than indicated. Some researchers add other centers to this list: one in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys of North America, and one on the Indian subcontinent.

What these regions had in common is high natural biological diversity, variable topography and climate, and human cultures ready to exploit the potential benefits of more intensive management of edible plant species. Since the local flora in each center was made up of a distinct assemblage of plant families and genera, the kinds of plants domesticated in each region varied greatly.

**FIGURE 15.3** **Centers of early agriculture and plant domestication.**

rapid growth and maximal production of desired parts and products—better wool, larger and more numerous eggs, more liters of milk, or more muscle tissue.

This selection process has, among other things, greatly altered the physiologies and morphologies of the domesticated species. In domesticated plants, carbon partitioning operates very differently than carbon partitioning in wild species. Crop plants store a much greater proportion of their biomass in their edible or harvestable parts than do the natural species from which they were derived. As a consequence, less energy is partitioned for use in traits or behaviors that confer **environmental resistance** —the ability to withstand stresses, threats, or limiting factors in the environment. In addition, many traits that once conferred environmental resistance have been lost from the genotype altogether. An analogous change has occurred in domesticated animal species. Because of these fundamental changes in the genetic basis of their physiology and morphology, many domesticated species and varieties require completely artificial and

optimum conditions. For plants, this means ideal soil moisture, nutrient availability, temperature, and sunlight, as well as the absence of pests, in order to perform well and express the high-yield traits for which they were selected. For animals, it often means controlled climatic conditions, antibiotics, and artificial insemination (the turkey breed that accounts for nearly all turkey production in the United States cannot reproduce without human assistance because body structure and extra meat limit animal movement).

Directed selection in agriculture has therefore led us into a difficult situation. Our major crop varieties require external inputs of inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and irrigation water to perform as designed, and many of our domesticated animals require hormones and antibiotics, highly controlled conditions, and highly processed feed. But such external inputs are the major cause of agriculture’s negative effect on the environment and on human health, and the degradation of the soil resource. If steps are taken to restrict the use of many of the practices and materials that humans have

Genetic Resources in Agroecosystems **177**

developed to protect and promote the growth of our crops and stock animals, yields and production can suffer.

This problem is particularly troubling with regard to pesticide use on crop plants. Plants’ natural abilities to withstand herbivory—through morphological adaptations, mutualistic interactions, the production of obnoxious compounds, and other methods—have been largely lost at the expense of the development of other traits. Agroecosystems become dependent on pesticide use to prevent loss of the crop through herbivory, but pesticide use becomes a selective pressure on the herbivore populations, resulting in their evolution toward pesticide resistance and requiring the application of more pesticide or the continual development of new pesticide types.

A fundamental problem is that traits of environmental resistance have been lost not just from the genetic makeup of individual species and varieties, but from the structure and organization of the entire agroecosystem (see Chapter 17). Attempts to reincorporate environmental resistance into domesticated species’ genomes, therefore, must work at the agroecosystem level, not just at the level of individual species, breeds, and varieties.

Farmers and crop breeders change the genetic makeup of crop species and varieties in a number of ways, ranging from indirect means that resemble natural selection to hightechnology means that work directly on the plant genome. Since these latter methods are not selection per se and because they raise special concerns from the standpoint of sustainability they are discussed on their own in the next section of this chapter.

The methods of directed selection that can be used on

a particular species depend on its manner of reproduction. Some plant species (more annuals than perennials) reproduce primarily by **self-pollination** —the female parts of a plant’s flowers are fertilized by pollen from the same plant, and often from the same flower. Other plant species (more perennials than annuals) reproduce mainly by **cross-pollination** . Such plants typically have some kind of morphological, chemical, or behavioral adaptation to assure that an individual’s female flower parts are fertilized only by pollen from other plants.

**Mass Selection**

Until relatively recently, the only method of directed selection was to collect seed from those individuals in a population that showed one or more desirable traits, such as high-yielding ability or disease resistance, and to use that seed for planting the next crop. This method, called **mass selection**, can produce a gradual shift in the relative frequency of a trait or traits in the population (Figure 15.4). Through mass selection methods, farmers all over the world have developed varieties called **landraces** . Landraces are adapted to local conditions, and although a landrace as a whole is genetically distinct, its members are genetically diverse (Figure 15.5).

Mass selection works similarly for both self-pollinated and cross-pollinated plants. When cross-pollinated plants are

among plants (if plants are

cross pollinated)

**FIGURE 15.4** **The mass selection process.** This method of selecting for desirable characteristics maintains adaptations to local conditions and allows for maximum genetic variability.

**FIGURE 15.5** **Four mass-selected, local landraces of corn** **from the lowlands of Tabasco, Mexico.** Each landrace has a different name, planting time, and preferred location.

involved, mass selection allows **open pollination** to occur. Also known as outcrossing, this natural mixing of pollen among the members of a population results in high genotypic variability. With self-pollinated plants, mass selection also allows the maintenance of relatively high variability.

This older, more traditional method of directed selection involves the whole organism and field-based selection; despite being a relatively slow process and more variable in its results, it has the advantage of being more like natural selection in natural ecosystems. Traits involving adaptation to local conditions are retained along with the more directly desirable aspects of yield or performance, and genotypic variability is maintained as well. Such characteristics are very important especially for small farm systems with limited resources and more variability in production conditions. All other methods of directed selection tend

to increase genetic uniformity, and most greatly reduce or eliminate the role of local environmental conditions in the

selection process.

**Pure Line Selection**

In self-pollinating plants, a common method of selection is to choose several superior-appearing plants from a variable population and then subject the progeny of each to extensive testing over many generations. At the end of the testing period, any line sufficiently distinct from and superior to existing varieties is released as a new variety. Because the plants are self-pollinating, the selected genotype stays relatively stable over time.

The pure line selection process can be modified in a variety of ways. One is to transfer genes between existing pure lines through artificial cross-pollination in an effort to produce a new line with a new combination of characteristics.

Sometimes this is accomplished by repeatedly backcrossing the progeny of an artificial cross with a parent having a specific desired characteristic.

**Production of Synthetic Varieties** In cross-pollinated plants, an analog to a self-pollinated pure line, called a **synthetic variety** or synthetic cultivar, can be created through a variety of techniques. The underlying principle is to limit the parental genotypes to a few that are known to have superior characteristics and to cross well. In alfalfa, for example, this can be done by planting seed from only a few specific sources (such as two or three clonal lines) in an isolated field and allowing natural crossing to occur. Seed produced from this field is then distributed as a synthetic variety. Synthetic varieties have greater genetic variability than self-pollinated pure line varieties, but far less variability than mass-selected, open-pollinated varieties.

**Hybridization** The primary method of directed selection today in many important crop plants—especially corn—is the production of hybrid varieties. A hybrid is a cross between two very different parents, each from a different pure-breeding line. The process of creating a hybrid variety involves two basic steps.

First, the two distinct pure-breeding lines are produced. (Pure breeding means that the genomes are largely homozygous at most gene loci.) In cross-pollinated plants (and selfpollinated plants that cross-pollinate frequently), this step involves artificial inbreeding, which is accomplished in a variety of ways.

Second, the two pure-breeding lines are crossed to produce the hybrid seed that is planted by farmers for production of the crop. Neither self-pollination nor cross-pollination between plants of the same line can occur in this step, necessitating the use of certain techniques. One technique, used in corn, is to plant the pollen-donor parental line and the seed-producing parental line in alternating rows or strips and to detassel the seed-producing plants before the tassels produce pollen (the tassels contain only male flowers). An alternative technique, used extensively in self-pollinated plants such as sorghum, is to introduce genetically controlled male sterility, called **cytoste-** **rility**, into one of the in-bred parental lines. This line is then used as the seed-producing parental line, because it can be pollinated only by pollen from the other, nonsterile parental line.

The hybrid offspring of two selectively in-bred parents are usually quite different from either parent. They are often larger and produce larger seeds or fruits, or have some other desirable characteristic not possessed by either parent. This response, known as **hybrid vigor** or **heterosis**, is one of the great advantages of a hybrid variety. Another desirable characteristic (from the standpoint of conventional agriculture) is genetic uniformity: all the hybrid seed of a particular cross will have the same genotype.

Hybrid varieties, however, have an inherent disadvantage (or advantage, from the perspective of seed companies). Seeds produced by hybrid plants—through either self- or cross-pollination—are usually undesirable for planting since sexual recombination will produce a variety of new gene combinations, most of which will not exhibit the hybrid vigor of the parents. Therefore, farmers must purchase hybrid seed each year from seed producers.

In crop types with tubers or other means of asexual reproduction, such as potatoes and asparagus, once a hybrid is produced with a suite of desirable traits, it is then propagated asexually as a **clone** . With advances in techniques of tissue culture, this method of propagating hybrids without seed has been applied more widely. Small amounts of tissue from different parts of important hybrid cultivars can be used to rapidly reproduce clones under strictly controlled conditions.

**Induced Polyploidy** Many of today’s important crop types, such as wheat, corn, coffee, and cotton, arose long ago as natural polyploids. Since polyploid plants are often more robust and have larger fruits or seeds than their normal diploid parents, people found them desirable when they occurred in early cropping systems, and they were selected for, even though farmers were not aware of what made them different.

When it was discovered by modern cytologists that many favorable traits in crop plants were the result of polyploidy, methods were developed to artificially induce it. Through the use of colchicine or other chemical stimulators during the first steps of meiosis, artificial multiplication of the number of chromosomes has become possible. Induced polyploidy has produced some of the most useful lines of wheat, for example, such as the hexaploid _Triticum aestivum_ . Once produced, polyploids themselves can then be used to perpetuate pure lines or develop new hybrids.

**TRANSGENIC MODIFICATION**

Plant breeding using the techniques described earlier is tedious, time consuming, and dependent to some extent on luck. Genes occur in the company of many other thousands or millions of genes on chromosomes, and the plant breeder can’t determine how a few genes of interest are distributed and recombined in each generation. Moreover, these techniques are restricted to breeding parents that are closely related—usually within the same species.

No such limitations exist for genetic engineers. Using various techniques developed during recent decades in the

rapidly advancing field of **genomics**, they can transfer single genes from one organism—a bacteria, for example—to another completely unrelated organism, such as a higher plant. They can also create synthetic genes or genetic sequences and incorporate them into the genomes of target organisms. These forms of **genetic engineering** enable crop geneticists to introduce specific traits, such as resistance to freezing or herbivory, into a crop species, and to create customized organisms, each with its own unique suite of traits.

As noted in Chapter 1, the end results of genetic engineering are called transgenic, genetically modified (GM), or genetically engineered (GE) organisms. Transgenic crops being planted today on a commercial basis include strains of corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, cotton, canola seed, sugar beets, tomatoes, lettuce, squash, peanuts, cassava, papaya, and potatoes. The area planted to these and other GE crops has increased steadily every year since the mid-1990s; in 2012 they covered an estimated 420 million acres (170 million hectares; see Figure 15.6). Throughout this period of rapid growth in the planting of biotech crops, one company— Monsanto Corporation—has maintained an 80%–90% share of the market in the United States.

GE crops are created with a variety of goals in mind. Some are intended to be resistant to attack by a particular pest, some to create food with better nutritive value, and some to resist the application of herbicides. Because of these and other characteristics, genetic engineering has been touted as the technological answer to many of the challenges faced by agriculture: producing more food, producing better food, reducing the need for pesticides and herbicides, and growing crops on marginal land (Table 15.1).

Transgenic modification of crop organisms has been controversial ever since it began to be practiced on a commercial basis in the 1990s. Although some applications of GE technologies may be seen as beneficial or to have beneficial aspects, even from an agroecological perspective, growing GE crops in general poses a variety of potential problems and serious risks. As just one example, several researchers and farm organizations have recently expressed concern about the problems associated with the unrestricted planting of GE

varieties of alfalfa, the fourth most planted crop in the United States after corn, wheat, and soybeans. Problems have begun to occur such as contamination of organic alfalfa plantings due to the ease of transfer of pollen by honeybees, contamination of honey by the wide foraging abilities of the bees, increased use of Roundup [®] herbicide and increased weed resistance, and contamination of hay crops used for organic animal feed (Hubbard 2008; Zerbe 2011).

Some of the potential drawbacks of growing transgenic crops are listed below. They are not all hypothetical; most have already been documented to occur.

- Unintended and hidden effects on the expression of

the genome. Although geneticists can insert specific genes and create GE organisms that express desired traits, they have little control over the unpredictable interaction of inserted genes with the organism’s own genes. A GE organism could, for example, exhibit resistance to a particular fungal disease but have a hidden vulnerability to a bacterial disease.

- Accelerated evolution of pesticide-resistant pests.

When a pest species is confronted with an environment consisting entirely of a crop producing a specific deterrence compound, natural selection will favor the evolution of resistance to that compound. This has already occurred in the case of many of the insect pests targeted by _Bacillus thuringiensis_ (Bt) crops, causing farmers to increase pesticide use.

- Evolution of weeds resistant to the herbicides used

alongside herbicide-resistant GE crops. This has already occurred in many areas, as weeds evolve the capacity to tolerate herbicides, causing farmers to increase the amounts of the herbicides they apply.

- Creation of “superweeds” through movement of

genes from crops to weeds. It may be possible for pest resistance, herbicide resistance, or improved-vigor genes to move from a GE crop species to a closely related noncrop species or variety, creating weeds even more resistant to human attempts to control them, or capable of disrupting natural ecosystems.

- Introduction of toxic agents and allergens into the

food supply. The compounds produced by genes imported into GE organisms may harm human consumers, in addition to deterring pests. Even if the genes are incorporated into varieties only meant for animal feed, they may find their way into the human food supply.

- Genetic pollution of the environment. Genes from

GE crops may jump to related native species (or, in the case of GE animals such as farmed salmon, to wild populations of the same species) with unpredictable consequences for natural ecosystems.

- Harm to wildlife and beneficial species. Toxins pro duced by GE crops may kill beneficial insects, pollinators, birds, and other animals, in addition to the targeted pests. The herbicides used in concert with herbicide-resistant GE crops also have a negative effect on beneficials and wildlife species by reducing the number of noncrop plants (both introduced weeds and native species) available for food and

cover.

- Consolidation of agribusiness control of genetic

resources. GE organisms are protected by patents and intellectual property laws. Their increased use reduces agrobiodiversity, makes farmers more dependent on off-farm inputs, and perpetuates the economic divide between developed and developing countries. In the long run, this may prove to be the

and able to grow in novel environments

most serious drawback of GE technology because it tends to be self-perpetuating.

In addition to all these problems, a broader objection to transgenic engineering of crop plants (and livestock) is that it has all the pitfalls—potentially magnified—of other modern plant breeding techniques. These are discussed below.

**CONSEQUENCES OF TRENDS IN THE**

**USE OF GENETIC RESOURCES**

Industrial agriculture, aided by advances in our knowledge of genetics, has marshaled the genetic resources of domesticated organisms to help create dramatic yield increases. But because the creation and deployment of new agricultural varieties and breeds has been directed primarily toward the goal of increasing the profits of agribusiness conglomerates, industrial agriculture has also threatened the foundation of the food system by tending to centralize the control over genetic resources, promote genetic uniformity, and narrow the diversity pool of our crop and livestock species. These trends undermine agriculture’s long-term sustainability by reducing genetic diversity at many levels, making domesticated species more vulnerable to pests, diseases, and environmental changes, and increasing the dependence of cropping and livestock production systems on human intervention and external inputs.

Genetic diversity in agriculture, or **agrobiodiversity**, matters in two ways: in the differences among organisms— what can be called diversity’s “genetic” component—and in how these differences are arrayed spatially in actual on-the-ground use—what we can term the “geographic” component of diversity (Brookfield 2001). And for each component, diversity matters at three distinct scales. Geographically, diversity is important at a worldwide scale, a regional or national scale, and a farm scale. Genetically, we can focus on the diversity of food types, the diversity within a species, or the diversity that exists within a particular breed or variety. Since these components of diversity are independent, they combine to create nine different facets of agrobiodiversity, from food diversity worldwide to the genetic diversity of a crop variety on a particular farm.

**TABLE 15.2**

**Facets of Agrobiodiversity, with Trends for Each**

These facets of agrobiodiversity, somewhat simplified, are shown in Table 15.2.

As a result of the ways that conventional agriculture has been exploiting the genetic resources at its disposal over the last century or so, agrobiodiversity is being lost in all nine ways. These trends of loss are also shown in Table 15.2.

There is no shortage of evidence that agrobiodiversity is declining at every geographic scale and every genetic level. This decline is seen in two interrelated ways: Fewer and more uniform varieties and breeds are in widespread use, and more varieties and breeds are disappearing from use and being lost altogether. Here are a few telling facts:

- There are perhaps as many as 300,000 edible plant

species on earth, but now more than 60% of the world’s dietary energy comes from just four of these plant species—wheat, rice, corn, and potatoes (Nierenberg and Halweil 2004; Kotschi 2010).

- Seventy percentage of the US dairy herd is Holstein,

and almost all chicken eggs sold (more than 90%) are laid by one breed, the white leghorn (Halweil 2004).

- Since 1900, more than 6000 known varieties of

apples (86% of those ever recorded) have become extinct (Fowler and Mooney 1990), as have half of the domesticated animal breeds in Europe, and about 1000 breeds of poultry and cattle worldwide (Hall and Ruane 1993).

- In Iran, one of the cradles of agrobiodiversity, only

about one-quarter of the total number of varieties of wheat, rice, and sorghum account for 70%–85% of the total area planted with these crops (Koocheki et al. 2006).

- Worldwide, at least 20% of animal breeds are in

danger of extinction, and somewhere in the world at least one breed of traditional livestock dies out each

month (FAO 2007).

over 70% of the world crop.

uniform—make up an increasing percentage of crops grown

worldwide.

**182** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

- About four-fifths of the maize varieties known in

Mexico in 1930 have been lost.

- In the last century, about 75% of plant genetic

diversity has been lost as farmers worldwide have abandoned their local varieties and landraces for

genetically uniform, high-yielding varieties (HYVs) (Nierenberg and Halweil 2004; FAO 2007).

The loss of agrobiodiversity is a cause for concern because it represents the loss of potentially valuable information that can never be recovered. If the accumulated genetic resources of thousands of years of plant and livestock breeding and domestication can be likened to a library full of books, old and new, on a vast array of subjects, then the impact of trends in conventional agriculture can be compared to replacing that library with one that loans only the current best-selling paperbacks.

The genetic information we are losing has a variety of proven and potential values:

- Genetic diversity in general is the raw material

for plant and animal breeding. Loss of this diversity will restrict opportunities for future breeding efforts.

- Genetic diversity in a crop or livestock species, as

manifested by the existence of many local landraces and breeds, allows the use of genetic lines that are well adapted to the particular conditions of specific localities. Locally adapted genetic lines, both in crops and in livestock, require fewer external inputs and are therefore a basis for sustainable

systems.

- Genetic diversity in a crop variety or livestock breed

is an important component of environmental resistance in the field. The broader the genetic basis of a crop or breed, the greater the chance that some individuals will have innate resistance to disease, unusual variations in environmental conditions, or herbivore attack in the case of crops, preventing total crop loss or herd decimation if one of these events should occur.

- Genetic diversity is also a _reservoir_ of potential

environmental resistance. A few individuals in a

genetically diverse crop variety or livestock breed may have genes or gene combinations that may confer resistance to future events or conditions, such as the spread of a new disease made possible by rising temperatures. These genes may be selected for in a population to provide it with resistance.

- Genetic diversity in crops ensures a reservoir of

traits with potential value for satisfying (in developed countries) the growing consumer demand for organically grown foods with higher nutritive value. Varieties with innate disease and pest resistance are much easier to grow in more sustainable low-input organic systems.

- Genetic diversity gives a system overall long-term

flexibility and resilience, the ability to adjust and adapt to changes in conditions from season to season and from decade to decade.

Some farmers, geneticists, plant breeders, and others saw several decades ago the dangers of losing genetic diversity in our food crops. One response was the establishment of “gene banks,” where the seeds of varieties and cultivars not in general use would be stored for possible later use. These gene banks serve an important purpose (see Qualset and Shands 2005), but are limited in what they can do to stem genetic erosion. First, the vast majority of current gene banks only maintain stocks of crops that have national and international research programs supporting them, and even then only a fraction of the genetic diversity of protected crops has been collected. Second, management and evaluation of genetic resources within gene banks is often lacking, so that deterioration of material occurs. Third, germplasm collections are really static, with no incorporation of the processes that maintain and create genetic diversity in the first place, including both environmental and cultural selection pressures. Unfortunately, we may never know how many varieties have already been lost, especially for the large number of minor crops that meet local needs around the world, but are not part of current germplasm preservation efforts.

**FIGURE 15.8** **An endangered variety of corn from rural** **Mexico.** Many pressures have pushed farmers away from using their local varieties, and many of those that are left are being contaminated by genetic material from GE varieties.

The erosion of diversity at the level of the variety or breed deserves a closer look. Therefore, we examine this subject in greater detail as it applies to crop plants.

All higher organisms have very complex genetic structures. A great many genes—a single plant can contain more than 10 million—all work together in complex ways to control the way the organism functions and interacts with its environment. Some genes act alone, but most appear to act in complex combinations with others. In nature, each species’ genetic totality, or genome, is the product of a very long evolutionary process, as described earlier. The genome as a whole is typically very diverse because it is made up of many individual genotypes, many or all of them unique.

Traditional methods of mass selection, though changing the content of a species’ genome, tend to preserve much of its genetically rich structure. Modern crop breeding, in contrast, tends to both alter and narrow a crop variety’s genome by focusing on the optimization of one or a few genotypes of the variety. Although this process creates plants that perform exceedingly well in specific, highly altered modern agricultural environments, it also greatly restricts a variety’s genetic basis. At the most uniform end of the scale, the genetic diversity of a crop variety is restricted to a single genome—that of the hybrid seed of that variety. At the most diverse end of the scale, the genetic diversity of a mass-selected, openpollinated variety is the product of countless unique individual genomes. Figure 15.9 illustrates this contrast in the structure of genetic diversity.

Commercially produced, hybrid, HYVs, have captured the seed market and are now planted over large areas in

Mass-selected, open-pollinated variety

genetically uniform fields. Their dominance is challenged only by equally uniform GE crops. This situation, along with the other types of loss of diversity, makes our crops increasingly vulnerable to the age-old enemies of agriculture— pests, diseases, and unusual weather.

**G** **enetic** **V** **ulnerability**

This consequence of the loss of genetic diversity in crop plants and livestock deserves further discussion. **Genetic** **vulnerability** is the susceptibility of the narrowed genetic stock of plants and animals to attack by pests and diseases, or to losses caused by extremes in the weather. The basic problem is that when a crop variety or livestock breed is genetically uniform over a large area, the ideal conditions for the rapid outbreak of a pest or disease population are in place.

Pest and disease populations evolve at a relatively rapid rate, in part because of their short generation time. With this capacity for rapid genetic change, they can adapt quickly to changes in their hosts’ defenses—or to factors (such as pesticides) introduced into the environment by humans. For this reason, pests and diseases in agriculture have been able to (and might always be able to) overcome just about everything agricultural science has thrown at them, from pesticides and antibiotics to GE crops designed to produce their own toxic compounds.

In traditional agroecosystems, where crop plants are subjected to both natural and human-imposed selection pressures and the system retains many of the characteristics of a natural ecosystem, crop plants have a fighting chance to stay one step ahead of pathogens and herbivores. But with

Genes and gene combinations in individuals’ genotypes

**FIGURE 15.9** **Genetic diversity in a mass-selected crop variety and a hybrid crop variety.** In a mass-selected variety, overall genetic diversity is much greater than that of any individual; in a hybrid variety, any individual contains all the genetic diversity of the variety.

**184** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

modern plant breeding, large-scale monocultures, and uniformity of farming practices, we have given pests and diseases the advantage. We strive to change both the genetic and environmental mechanisms of resistance by breeding crops for specific traits rather than general fitness, and by planting crops in large single-species populations at the same time in the same place. This creates an environment that is more uniform and predictable than it might otherwise be, setting the stage for outbreaks to occur.

Moreover, changes independent of agriculture are increasing the threat of serious outbreaks of disease and pests. The interconnections of global commerce give pathogens ever more vectors for expansion into new areas, and climate change threatens both to allow pathogens to move into areas where the climate formerly excluded them, and to put stresses on crop plants that make them more vulnerable to pest and pathogen attack.

The increasing uniformity of the genetic base in livestock production also makes poultry, cattle, swine, goats, and sheep more vulnerable to the spread of disease. In more traditional pastoral systems, livestock breeds vary regionally and are well adapted to local conditions, providing good resistance to disease. In contrast, modern confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) pack large numbers of genetically similar animals together in an artificial context that is the perfect setting for the rapid spread of a pathogen.

One of the most well-known examples of the dangers of genetic uniformity is the Irish Potato Blight. In 1846 the late-blight fungus ( _Phytophthora infestans_ ) destroyed half of Ireland’s potato crop, causing widespread famine and forcing a quarter of the population to emigrate. The blight occurred because Irish potato farmers had developed a dependence on only two potato genotypes that had been brought to the country over 300 years before and then vegetatively propagated; the blight had such a profound impact because the country had become overly dependent on the carbohydrate-rich potato as a food source. The fungus was well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of the region, and once the disease arrived and got established, there was no stopping it. Interestingly, the same fungus is also found in the place of origin of the potato, the Andes of South America, but the great genetic diversity of potatoes there, combined with ongoing natural selection, ensures that a large proportion of the crop will be resistant.

Another well-known example is the 1970–1971 outbreak of southern corn leaf blight ( _Helminthosporium maydis_ ), which destroyed almost the entire corn crop in areas of Illinois and Indiana and resulted in the loss of more than 15%

of the corn crop in the United States as a whole (Ullstrup 1972). This outbreak was linked to the genetic factors for cytosterility bred into the lines of corn used to produce hybrid seed. These factors produced male sterility and eliminated the need for expensive hand detasseling, but they also increased the hybrid’s susceptibility to southern corn leaf blight. When a new strain of the blight appeared, therefore, it spread quickly. Seed producers and crop breeders were able to respond quickly and altered the combination of susceptible factors by the 1972 season.

Similar problems have been encountered with wheat. Ninety percent of the wheat varieties grown worldwide are susceptible to infection by lineages of Race Ug99 of the fungus _Puccinia graminis tritici_, which causes stem or black rust disease on wheat. Ug99 was first detected in Uganda in 1998, and by 2011 seven races belonging to the Ug99 lineage had developed and were known to have spread to various wheat-growing countries in the eastern African highlands, as well as Zimbabwe, South Africa, Sudan, Yemen, and Iran. Because this fungus spreads readily and most wheat lacks resistance to it, the Ug99 group of races has been recognized as a major threat to wheat production and food security. Even if a dedicated program to developing and distributing new wheat varieties with broad and durable resistance is success ful, wheat production in many parts of the world is at great risk (Singh et al. 2011).

The lesson is clear: as long as only a few varieties dominate, pests will be able to take advantage of the low genetic diversity of the crop and overcome its resistance. When failure occurs, farmers are totally dependent on the infrastructure that produces new resistant varieties (or provides chemical pesticides) since they no longer have access to the genetic variability that used to be present in their own fields (Eigenbrode 2011).

In many ways the overall success of agriculture in developed countries over the past three decades has masked the problem of genetic vulnerability. Surplus yields in some regions can compensate for failures elsewhere. But the regional failures are still happening, and the potential exists for failures on a larger scale (Qualset and Shands 2005).

**I** **ncreased** **D** **ependence** **on** **H** **uman** **I** **ntervention**

There is an important link between conventional agriculture’s control of genetic resources and its dependence on external inputs, mechanization, and off-the-farm technological expertise. The dramatic reduction of the genetic diversity of our crops and livestock breeds has been closely paralleled by the dramatic increases in pesticide, herbicide, and fertilizer production, irrigation and water use, mechanization, and agricultural use of fossil fuels.

This link is very clear in the widespread use of hybrid crop seeds. A modern hybrid crop variety is virtually helpless outside the confines of the farm—it usually can’t even reproduce itself from its own seed. At the greatest extreme, the crop can’t succeed in a farming system without very specific kinds of intensive, technology-based human modification and control of the farm environment.

When a farmer abandons local crop varieties for hybrids, it is more than the hybrid seed that has to be purchased. Every hybrid has a “package” of inputs and practices that go along with the seed: soil cultivation equipment, irrigation systems, soil amendments and fertilizers, pest control materials, and other on-farm inputs. The package also includes changes in many other aspects of the farm organization and management as well. In order to recover the investment necessary to pay for these new inputs and equipment, farmers

Genetic Resources in Agroecosystems **185**

often must intensify the production of more profitable crops. This usually requires a concentration of production in fewer and fewer crops, a dependence on centralized market structures, a differently skilled labor force, and further intensification of inputs to reduce risk and the chance of crop failure. Technical advice is relied upon (and usually paid for) from sources outside the farm environment. The entire farm is

forced to change.

These changes too often result in farmers losing the important local, traditional knowledge they have about crops, the farm, and the farming process and relying on genetic information that was developed under highly uniform, highly modified conditions. Cumulatively, the end result is the loss of the local genetic diversity and cultural experience that characterized farms before modernization.

GE crops make agriculture even more dependent on human intervention. Indeed, from the perspective of the agribusiness firms that develop GE products, that is often the point: every additional need for an input or manipulation is an opportunity to make more money. Herbicide-resistant varieties are a good example of this phenomenon because the seeds are designed to be used in concert with herbicides. And when weeds begin to become resistant to the herbicides, the ready solution to the problem is more inputs in the form of more herbicide application. Even when a GE product is marketed as something designed to reduce inputs—as is the case with Bt varieties reducing the need for pesticides—the eventual reality is often different because of the quick evolution of resistance in the target pests.

The link between the erosion of genetic diversity in livestock breeds and the input intensiveness of conventional livestock production, especially in CAFOs, has already been touched upon in Chapter 1. The whole rationale of largescale livestock production—to produce large quantities of animal-derived food products at the lowest cost—depends on both the management efficiency gained through genetic uniformity and the tightly controlled, input-dependent environment in which the animals are raised.

**L** **oss** **of** **O** **ther** **G** **enetic** **R** **esources**

Agriculture depends on more than just the genetic diversity of crop plants and domesticated animals. Also important is the genetic diversity of an array of other organisms: (1) organisms in the natural ecosystems surrounding agroecosystems, especially the wild relatives of crop plants; (2) crops and animal breeds of minor economic importance; and (3) beneficial noncrop organisms—such as parasitoids, allelopathic weeds, trees, and soil organisms.

Wild relatives of crops are an important source of new or novel variation in the directed selection process. They have been important sources of new or stronger genetic material, especially in the event of epidemics of the aforementioned type. However, wild relatives, such as the wild cotton in Figure 15.10, are disappearing rapidly in many parts of the world because of deforestation and other forms of habitat modification.

**FIGURE 15.10** **Wild perennial cotton (** _**Gossypium**_ **sp.) in** **Tabasco, Mexico.** Wild relatives of crops can still be found in situ in traditional farming systems.

A similar kind of organism with potential value is the natural cross between an escaped agricultural variety and its wild relative. Such crosses are endangered as well because the habitats where crops and wild relatives can exchange genetic material are becoming rarer, mainly due to the spread of hybrid seed into even the most remote agricultural parts of the world, the simplification of the farming environment that accompanies the use of improved varieties, and the increasing separation between agricultural and natural ecosystems.

Diverse agricultural habitats also contain many minor crop species that are of considerable importance for the entire system. Besides providing an array of harvestable useful products, these crops contribute to the ecological diversity of the system. They are part of the whole-system energy flow and nutrient cycling process. Minor crops of little or no current commercial value are preserved in many traditional cropping systems, especially in the developing world. They could have promising value for future use, but they too are disappearing as traditional systems give way to modernization.

Apart from crops and crop relatives, agroecosystems are also made up of a diversity of noncrop plants and animals, including predators and parasites of pests, allelopathic weeds, and beneficial soil organisms. Many of these can play very important roles in maintaining overall system diversity and resilience (see Chapter 17). Since their presence and genetic diversity depends to a great extent on the overall diversity of the system, they are threatened by the tendency toward agroecosystem uniformity.

More generally, attention needs to be paid to the overall genetic diversity of agroecosystems. A fully functioning crop and farm system preserves all of the genetic, ecological, and cultural processes that produce diversity in the first place. Biological control information, plant defenses, symbionts, and competitors are all actively interacting and preserving genetically based information that is of great agroecological value. And since only a fraction of all this information is in the germplasm of the key crop, loss of farming habitats can be even more devastating than narrowing of the crop gene pool itself.

**186** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

**PRESERVING AGROBIODIVERSITY**

Sustainability requires a fundamental shift in how we manage and manipulate the genetic resources in agroecosystems. The key theme in this shift is genetic diversity. Sustainable agroecosystems are genetically diverse at every level, from the genome of the individual organisms to the system as a whole. And this diversity should be a product of coevolution—genetic changes should have occurred in an environment of interaction among the various populations. In this way, all of the component organisms—crop plants, animals, noncrop associates, beneficial organisms, and so on—are adapted to local conditions and the local variability of the environment, in addition to possessing traits that make them specifically useful to humans.

Traditional, indigenous, and local agroecosystems contain many of the genetic elements of sustainability, and we can learn from their example. In particular, they have higher genetic diversity within populations as well as in the cropping community as a whole. Intercropping is much more common, noncrop species and wild relatives occur within and around cropping fields, and opportunities for genetic diversification are abundant at the field level. In such systems, resistance to environmental stress and biotic pressures has a much broader genetic base, genetic vulnerability is lower, and while pests and diseases occur, catastrophic outbreak is rare. In essence, genetic change in such systems takes place much like it does in natural ecosystems.

**B** **reeding** **for** **D** **urable** **R** **esistance** **in** **C** **rop** **P** **lants**

Agricultural plant breeding has focused mainly on creating resistance to limiting factors of the environment, be they physical factors such as drought, poor soils, and temperature extremes, or biological factors such as herbivory, disease, and competition from weeds. Remarkable gains in yield have been achieved as a result of these breeding programs, but as we have already noted, another result is increased vulnerability to crop failure and increasing reliance on nonrenewable inputs.

As each problem presents itself, crop breeders screen the genetic variability of a crop until they find a resistant genotype. This resistance is often provided by a single gene. The gene-transfer and backcrossing techniques described earlier are employed to incorporate the gene into a specific crop pedigree. The result is sometimes called vertical resistance. It has two weaknesses. First, the resistance will continue to function only as long as the limiting factor does not change. Unfortunately, in the case of pests, diseases, and weeds, the limiting factor is never static for very long because of continual natural selection. So, the problem organism eventually develops “resistance to the resistance,” and an outbreak or epidemic occurs. This dynamic is the basis of the well-known crop breeders’ treadmill. Second, in the process of breeding for vertical resistance, genes providing partial resistance to the wider spectrum of pathogens are lost.

**FIGURE 15.11** **Dr. Roberto García-Espinosa, distributing** **seeds of some of the horizontally resistant beans he bred.** During his career at the Colegio de Postgraduados in Montecillos, Mexico, Dr. García-Espinosa ran a highly successful breeding program developing beans resistant to the broad range of pathogens present in the Mixteca bean-growing region of Mexico. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Don Lotter.)

A more durable type of resistance is needed that does not break down easily in the face of new strains of pests, diseases, or weeds. Rather than directing breeding programs toward the development of specific resistances, the idea is to manage the whole crop system. Selection for durable resistance requires the accumulation of many resistance characters using population-level breeding methods, and relies on an understanding of the simultaneous nature of the interaction between a crop, pests, the environment, and the human managers. Selection takes place at all levels at the same time, rather than for single specific characters. The more durable type of resistance that results is termed **horizontal resistance** (Robinson 1996; Garcia-Espinosa 2010) (Figure 15.11).

Breeding methods that provide the most durable resistance rely on the use of open-pollinated, locally adapted landraces. Open-pollinated crops are generally lower yielding when compared to hybrid varieties, but they are very responsive to local selection pressures because of their genetic diversity. They also have the best average performance in the face of the combination of all the local environmental factors, including pests, diseases, and weeds.

The importance of system-level resistance is accepted more easily by ecologists than by agricultural scientists. The study of selection in natural ecosystems has repeatedly demonstrated the ways a wild ecotype responds to either positive or negative selection pressures when it is introduced into an ecosystem different from the one in which it evolved. Selection operates simultaneously at the level of all of the factors, biotic and abiotic, that the organism encounters. Seen in this light, the problems associated with genetic uniformity in crops become more apparent.

Genetic Resources in Agroecosystems **187**

The concern for the erosion and loss of genetic resources led to the establishment in 1974 of the International Board of

Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR). An international network of ex situ (off-site) crop germplasm repositories was established and genetic material from the major crop gene centers was collected in order to establish the IBPGR system of gene banks. Plant breeders have since relied heavily on these genetic resources for the conventional development of higheryielding and resistant varieties, and the number of gene banks of all types has increased to an FAO-estimated 1460 worldwide, which together hold more than 5.4 million samples. In 2004, the FAO and the 15 Future Harvest Centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) partnered to create the Crop Diversity Trust, an independent international organization charged with assuring the long-term security of our most important collections of crop diversity. In particular, the trust seeks to salvage collections that are at risk and to assist developing countries with managing their collections. In its evaluation of the state of plant genetic resources worldwide released in 2007, FAO reiterated its support for strengthening the network of ex situ gene banks, especially those that have a more local and regional focus within different countries (FAO 2010).

Although ex situ conservation is important, it cannot by itself stem the erosion of agricultural genetic diversity. Limited funding for gene banks has restricted the range of crops and regions from which material is collected, leaving much of the world’s crop genetic diversity out of these reservoirs. Corn, wheat, beans, rice, and potatoes have received the most attention, excluding a very large number of much of the world’s food crops. An added problem is that these ex situ genetic conservation efforts remove crops from their original cultural–ecological context, severing the adaptive tie between genome and environment (Nevo 1998; FAO 2010).

To achieve sustainability, conservation of genetic resources must also occur in situ or in the setting of the crop community, and farmers must be rewarded for doing so (Brush 2004; FAO 2014). In situ conservation involves ongoing selection and genetic change, rather than static preservation. It allows genetic screening to occur, maintaining and strengthening local landraces. It attempts to mimic all the conditions—location, timing, and cultivation techniques—under which future cultivation of the crop will occur. As a result, cultivars remain well adapted to (1) the conditions of the local environment, (2) the cultural conditions of the local environment (such as irrigation, cultivation, and fertilization), and (3) all the locally important biotic crop problems (such as pests, diseases, and weeds).

In situ conservation requires that farms be the repositories of genetic information and farmers the repositories of the cultural knowledge of how crops are cared for and managed.

At one extreme, therefore, the principle of in situ conservation argues for each farm having its own breeding and preservation program. Indeed, farmers ought to be able to select and preserve their own locally adapted landraces where feasible. But a more practical approach focuses at the regional level. Because regional characteristics of a farming region establish important selection criteria, screening programs can be centralized to a certain extent for a particular geographically and ecologically defined region, as long as constant exchange of crop genetic material takes place among farmers of that region (Brush 1995; Cunningham 2001).

In situ conservation becomes particularly important in the context of climate change. The landraces and varieties growing in a given diverse agroecosystem will evolve in response to the selection pressures presented by directional environmental changes such as increasing aridity and increasing warmth. These crop plants will not only be better adapted to the unique manifestations of climate change in that region, but their adaptations may make them well suited for planting in other areas where conditions are changing in the same way. In addition, the genetically diverse populations conserved and selected for at in situ conservation sites will be crucial sources

of the population- and agroecosystem-level resilience that climate change will demand of agroecosystems in the future.

Ultimately, in situ and ex situ genetic resource conservation efforts must be integrated. Already, partnerships between nonprofit groups and farmers show that the two kinds of programs can complement each other and promote more effective and equitable conservation. The organization Native Seeds/SEARCH in Tucson, AZ, for example, complements its ex situ seed collection and storage activities by encouraging farmers to grow local and traditional varieties of crops. The organization provides seeds for farmers who have lost varieties, and then purchases the farmers’ excess production. The farmers’ own fields, then, become the sites for both the retention of traditional genetic resources and the screening grounds for the varieties of the future. When these fields also use local knowledge, local resources, and limited industrial inputs, breeding for sustainability can take place (Tuxill and Nabhan 2001; Nabhan 2002).

Genetic resources in agroecosystems extend beyond the relatively few crop species that today provide the bulk of the food consumed by much of the human population. Locally important, minor, or underutilized crops, as well as a range of noncrop species with potential as new crops, all form part of the genetic resources available for breeding programs for sustainable agriculture. They also form part of the whole-system, horizontal resistance process that is essential for maintaining a genetic basis for sustainable agricultural systems. It is important, therefore, to extend genetic conservation efforts to include all these other types of crop, noncrop, and wild relative species. This goal is best achieved by preserving the traditional agroecosystems in which these species occur (Altieri and Nicholls 2004a).

Genetic diversity in livestock is valuable for the same reasons as genetic diversity in crops: a diversity of breeds (and diversity within a breed) gives farmers the raw material for selecting stocks or developing new breeds in response to environmental changes, new disease threats, and changing market conditions or consumer preferences. Livestock breeds indigenous to particular locales often have valuable traits such as high fertility, good maternal instincts, disease resistance, ability to thrive on poor-quality feed, adaptation to harsh conditions, longevity, and unique product characteristics. All of these traits are desirable—and necessary— for low-input livestock production, and often missing in the widespread commercial breeds. Thus indigenous breeds of poultry, swine, cattle, and other livestock types are crucial for sustainable livestock production.

Despite the value of genetic diversity in livestock, however, it is at greater risk than the genetic diversity of our crop plants, in part because an animal’s genome can’t easily be stored in a gene bank. The FAO has estimated that as many as 43% of the livestock breeds in the world are threatened

with extinction.

Recognizing the multiple roles that animals can play in sustainability offers a chance to reverse this trend. As we will see in Chapter 19, local and traditional breeds can play a critical role in the process of reintegrating livestock animals into crop production systems—a necessary step in the creation of sustainable food systems (Figure 15.12).

**GENETICS AND SUSTAINABILITY**

agriculture and to bring under their control as much as they can all the factors of production. Since crop plants and livestock are the primary factors of production, and because their genomes determine how they function in this regard, agribusiness has, sensibly enough, focused much attention on genetics. If agriculture in the industrial model is like a factory, then the ability to manipulate genomes is like gaining access to the factory’s master control panel. Seen in this light, genomics has presented agrofood corporations with something akin to the key to the treasury.

Aware of the importance of genetics in generating profits and centralizing control over production, agribusiness corporations have invested considerable resources in advancing the technologies that allow them to create hybrid seeds and to manipulate genomes, and they are active in applying this technological know-how to developing marketable products, packages, and services. The extraordinarily rapid and extensive adoption of GM/GE crops since 1996 is a clear indicator of how perfectly genomics fits in to the industrial model. It takes the strategy embodied in the development and marketing of hybrid seeds and moves it one step further.

All of the practices and approaches of industrial agriculture, of course, have consequences. Although some of these consequences—such as erosion of agrobiodiversity—have effects that are gradual enough for them to escape most people’s notice for now, others generate problems that are difficult to ignore in the present. The widespread use of GE crops with herbicide resistance and Bt genes is in this latter category. Growing resistance in weeds to glyphosate and in insects to Bt toxins is a major headache for farmers today. Does this mean that agribusiness is recognizing that deployment of these “products” was a mistake? The response of Monsanto, which developed the glyphosate-resistant and Bt crops in the first place, indicates that this might be a hasty conclusion. Monsanto is developing a new product, based on new GE technology called RNA transfer, that is designed to overcome weeds’ resistance to glyphosate. That it would attempt to solve a problem caused by GE technology with more GE technology is really no surprise, since that is the approach most consistent with the industrial model.

The growing power of agrofood corporations and their apparent ability to manage the problems generated by industrial agriculture highlights the challenges we face in preserving agrobiodiversity. Agrofood corporations are interested in the genetic diversity present in the world’s crop varieties and livestock breeds only to the extent that they can appropriate it for their own purposes. At the same time, the logic of industrial agriculture promotes a drive toward genetic uniformity at all levels that means a continual loss of irrecoverable

genetic information and an increase in genetic vulnerability that humankind can ill afford as the climate changes in unfavorable directions.

If industrial agriculture entails an ongoing loss of agrobiodiversity, the only real solution is fundamental change in the food system and the development of an alternative to the industrial agriculture model. In the meantime, efforts to stem the tide of agrobiodiversity erosion will have to rely on measures

that exist outside the market—such as conservation projects funded by governments, NGOs, and farmer organizations— and on the preservation of traditional systems and the development of alternative systems that exist at the margins of the food system and preserve the agrobiodiversity that they have access to. Although these efforts will, for the foreseeable future, not receive a level of support anywhere near comparable to that of the profits generated by agribusiness, they are absolutely crucial because of the degree to which agriculture depends on its domesticated species in their full range of diversity.

The incredible diversity of crop varieties and livestock breeds developed by farmers and breeders over thousands of years, along with the wild relatives and noncrop beneficials that grow with them, are a resource and a legacy that belong to all human beings. They are a commons, like air, water, and soil, and, like these aspects of the environment, they are in danger of being appropriated and destroyed for the sake of private profit. Preventing further loss of this common heritage requires the same kind of ethic of stewardship, responsibility, and attention to the common good under which domesticated species were developed originally (Table 15.3).

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. What are the similarities and differences between

an obligate mutualism in a natural ecosystem and the relationship between humans and their domesticated organisms? 2. What can we learn from traditional farming

systems in developing countries about applying directed selection in a way that promotes sustainability? 3. What are the weaknesses of a germplasm preserva tion program that focuses only on the key crops and the storing of genetic material in large environmentally controlled germplasm banks isolated from the field situation? 4. How do your own personal choices at the market

exert pressure on the selection of the genetic material used by farmers? 5. What is meant by “agroecosystem selection” in the

directed selection process? 6. What are the advantages to “farmer to farmer”

or participatory seed saving and exchange, and how can they be promoted and protected at a time when it is possible to obtain patents for genetic material?
