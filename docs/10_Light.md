## chapter 4. Light

Light from the sun is the primary source of energy for ecosystems. It is captured by plants through photosynthesis and its energy stored in the chemical bonds of organic compounds. Sunlight also drives the earth’s weather: light energy transformed into heat affects rainfall patterns, surface temperature, wind, and humidity. The way these factors of the environment are distributed over the face of the earth deter mines climate and is of considerable importance in agriculture. All these light-related factors will be reviewed in more detail in subsequent chapters.

This chapter focuses on the light environment as it directly affects agroecosystems. The light environment includes that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum from the invisible ultraviolet (UV) through the visible light spectrum to the invisible infrared (IR). This chapter also discusses how the light environment can be managed to more efficiently channel this renewable source of energy through the system, use it to maintain the many and diverse functions of the system, and ultimately convert part of it into sustainable harvests.

**SOLAR RADIATION**

The energy the earth receives from the sun arrives in the form of electromagnetic waves varying in length from less than 0.001 nanometers (nm) to more than 1,000,000,000 nm. This energy makes up what is known as the electromagnetic spectrum. The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between about 1 and 1,000,000 nm is considered to be light, although not all of it is visible. Light with a wavelength between 1 and 390 nm is UV light. Visible light is the next component, made up of light with wavelengths between 400 and 760 nm. Light with a wavelength longer than 760 nm and shorter than 1,000,000 nm is known as IR light, and like UV light is invisible to the eye; when the wavelength of IR light extends beyond 3000 nm, however, it is sensed as heat. Figure 4.1 shows how the electromagnetic spectrum is divided into types of energy.

**ATMOSPHERE AS FILTER AND REFLECTOR**

When light first arrives from the sun at the outer edge of the earth’s atmosphere, it is comprised of approximately 10% UV light, 50% visible light, and 40% IR light or heat energy. As this light interacts with the earth’s atmosphere, several things can happen to it, as shown in Figure 4.2.

Some light is _dispersed_ or scattered—its path toward the surface is altered due to the interference from molecules

in the atmosphere, but its wavelength is not changed in the

process. Most dispersed light reaches the surface, but in the process gives the atmosphere its unique blue color. Some light is _reflected_ off of the atmosphere back out into space; its wavelength is also unchanged in the process. Finally, some light is _absorbed_ by water, dust, smoke, ozone, carbon dioxide, or other gases in the atmosphere. The absorbed energy is stored for a period of time, and then _reradiated_ as longerwave heat energy. Almost all UV light with a wavelength of 300 nm or less is absorbed by the earth’s atmosphere before it strikes the surface. (UV light with a wavelength below 200 nm is potentially lethal to living organisms.) The light that is not reflected off the atmosphere or absorbed is _trans-_ _mitted_ and reaches the surface. This energy is mostly visible light, but also includes some UV light and IR light.

At the earth’s surface, this transmitted light is absorbed by soil, water, or organisms. Some of the absorbed energy is reflected back into the atmosphere, and some is reradiated as heat.

Over the last several hundred years in particular, humans have added gases and tiny particles to the atmosphere that have changed the way in which the atmosphere reflects, disperses, and transmits light. These changes in atmospheric composition are at the root of climate change. Subsequent chapters will explore in more detail how changes in its composition affect the atmosphere’s interaction with light from the sun and ultimately affect factors of crucial importance to plants—temperature, precipitation patterns, and wind. This chapter sets those issues aside so that it may focus on the ways in which sunlight considered as an ecological factor affects plant growth and functioning.

**ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE**

**OF LIGHT ON EARTH**

All wavelengths of light that reach the earth’s surface have significance for the living organisms that occupy the planet. Over evolutionary time, organisms have developed different adaptations for accommodating themselves to the various spectra. These adaptations vary from active energy capture to deliberate avoidance of solar energy exposure.

**U** **ltraviolet** **L** **ight**

Only about 1% of the UV light entering the earth’s outer atmosphere actually reaches the surface. The rest is absorbed by a layer of ozone gas high in the atmosphere. Despite this reduction in its intensity at the surface, UV light can be active in certain chemical reactions in plants. Together with the

**FIGURE 4.1** **The electromagnetic spectrum.** The sun emits the full spectrum of electromagnetic energy, but the atmosphere reflects and filters out most of the shortwave radiation, much of the IR, and the longest wavelength radio waves. A relatively narrow band of energy centered on the visible light spectrum reaches the earth’s surface mostly unimpeded.

**FIGURE 4.2** **The fate of light upon reaching the earth.** Trans­ mitted light from the sun is mostly in the visible light range; reradiated energy is mostly in the IR range.

shorter wavelengths of visible light, UV tends to promote the formation of plant pigments known as anthocyanins, and can be involved in the inactivation of certain hormonal systems important for stem elongation and phototropism.

In general, however, UV radiation is harmful to plant tissues. Plants (as well as animals) are therefore very dependent on the screening effect of the ozone layer. Although the opaque epidermis of most plants reduces the amount of harmful UV entering sensitive tissue or cells, an increase in UV exposure beyond the amount for which plants have evolved adaptations can damage leaf cells, inhibit photosynthesis and growth, and promote mutations.

Since the middle of the last century, humans have been releasing compounds into the atmosphere that can make their way into the stratosphere and destroy ozone molecules. These compounds, which include chlorofluorocarbons used as coolants and propellants, and agricultural fumigants like methyl bromide, become highly effective ozone assassins when UV radiation tears off their chlorine or bromine atoms, turning these atoms into free radicals that react destructively with ozone. As these compounds, collectively known

as halocarbons, accumulated in the upper atmosphere, they began to affect the ozone layer. By the 1980s, significant thinning of the ozone layer had been observed over the southern polar region and levels of UV irradiation at the surface had increased in many places. This caused so much worry that most of the countries of the world agreed in 1987 to phase out production and use of halocarbons.

This 1987 agreement, called the Montreal Protocol, has been effective at greatly reducing emissions of halocarbons, allowing the ozone layer to undergo some “healing” since the 1990s. However, many scientists are still very concerned about the long-term status of the ozone layer. One problem is that halocarbons still continue to be produced, particularly for use in air conditioners in unregulated markets in the developing world, and such use is likely to increase as the middle class expands in these countries and as increasing temperatures make air conditioning seem more necessary. Another cause for worry is accumulating evidence that climate change is helping to destroy ozone in the stratosphere through several different mechanisms. In one such mechanism, the highly energetic storms that are becoming more common as the earth warms are sending water vapor high enough into the atmosphere to interact with sulfate aerosols and in this form present the ozone layer with yet another serious antagonist. If the UV protection offered by the ozone layer does indeed decline as climate change progresses, the consequences for agriculture could be significant.

**P** **hotosynthetically** **A** **ctive** **R** **adiation**

The light energy in the visible spectrum is of greatest importance in agroecosystems. Depending on local climatic conditions, it forms 40%–60% of the total energy of solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface. Also known as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), this is the light with wavelengths between 400 and 760 nm. Green plants will not grow without a combination of most of the wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum.

Not all the light in this spectrum is of equal value in photosynthesis, however. The photoreceptors in chlorophyll are most absorptive of violet–blue and orange–red light; green and yellow light are not as useful. Since chlorophyll cannot absorb green light very well, most of it is reflected back, making plants appear green. Figure 4.3 shows how the absorbance of chlorophyll varies with wavelength.

The wavelengths of light that chlorophyll absorbs best correspond roughly to the wavelengths at which photosynthesis is most efficient.

**I** **nfrared** **L** **ight**

IR light energy with a wavelength from 800 to 3000 nm— sometimes referred to as the near-IR range—has an important role in influencing the hormones involved in germination, a plant’s response to changes to day length, and other plant processes. In the range beyond 3000 nm, IR light becomes heat, and different ecological impacts are evident. (Temperature as an ecological factor is discussed in Chapter 5.)

**CHARACTERISTICS OF VISIBLE LIGHT EXPOSURE**

Light energy in the visible or PAR range is converted by photosynthesis into chemical energy, and eventually into the biomass that drives the rest of the agroecosystem, including the part we harvest for our own use. To manage agroecosystems in a way that maximizes the efficiency of this process, it is important to understand how the light to which plants are exposed can vary.

**Q** **uality**

Visible light can vary in the relative amounts of the colors that make it up—this is referred to as the light’s quality. The largest proportion of direct sunlight at the earth’s surface is at the center of the visible light spectrum, dropping off slightly at both the violet and red ends. The diffuse light from the sky—such as what occurs in the shade of a building—is relatively higher in blue and violet light. Since different portions of the visible light spectrum can be used for photosynthesis more efficiently than others, light quality can have an important effect on photosynthetic efficiency.

A number of factors can cause light quality to vary. In the interior of some cropping systems, for example, canopy species remove most of the red and blue light, leaving primarily transmitted green and far-red light. Light quality can therefore become a limiting factor for plants under the canopy, even though the total amount of light may appear to be adequate.

**I** **ntensity**

The total energy content of all the light in the PAR range that reaches a leaf surface is the intensity of that light. Light intensity can be expressed in a variety of energy units, but the most common are the langley (cal/cm [2] ), the watt (J/s), and the einstein (6 × 10 [23] photons). All of these units of measure express the amount of energy falling on a surface over some time period. At very high light intensities, photosynthetic pigments become saturated, meaning that additional light does not effectively increase the rate of photosynthesis. This level of light intensity is called the **saturation point** . Excessive light can lead to degradation of chlorophyll pigments and even cause harm to plant tissue. At the other extreme, low levels of light can bring a plant to the **light** **compensation point**, or the level of light intensity where the amount of photosynthate produced is equal to the amount needed for respiration. When the light intensity goes below the compensation point, the energy balance for the plant is negative. If the negative balance is not offset by a time period of active photosynthesis and energy gain, the plant may die.

**D** **uration**

The length of time that leaf surfaces are exposed to sunlight each day can impact photosynthetic rates as well as longerterm plant growth and development. Duration of light exposure is also an important variable in how light intensity or quality can affect a plant. Exposure to excessive levels of light for a short time, for example, can be tolerated, whereas a longer period of exposure can be damaging. Or a short period of intensive light, allowing the plant to produce an excess of photosynthate, can then allow for tolerance of a longer period below the light compensation point.

— The total number of hours of daylight—the **photoperiod** is also an important aspect of the duration of light exposure. A variety of plant responses, as will be discussed in detail in the following, have specific chemical triggers or control mechanisms that can be activated or deactivated depending on the number of hours of daylight, or in some cases, the number of dark hours without sunlight.

**DETERMINANTS OF VARIATIONS**

**IN THE LIGHT ENVIRONMENT**

The quality and quantity of light received by a plant in a specific location and the duration of its exposure to light are a function of several important factors including

**46** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

seasonality, latitude, altitude, topography, air quality, and the structure of the vegetation canopy.

**S** **easonality**

Except at the equator, daylight hours are longest during the summer and shortest in the winter, reaching their extremes at the corresponding solstice. Since the angle of the sun in relation to the surface is much lower toward the poles during the winter, the sunlight that is available has to pass through more atmospheres before it reaches the plant, making that sunlight much less intense. Therefore, both intensity and duration of light are affected by seasonality. Many plants have adapted to the seasonal variations in day length and light intensity through the selection of adaptations that either prepare the plant for the upcoming winter or get it ready to take advantage of more optimal conditions for growth and development as spring progresses into summer. The timing of many agricultural activities—such as planting and pruning—corresponds to the changing hours of daylight at specific times of the year.

**L** **atitude**

The closer to either of the poles, the greater the seasonal variation in day length. Above the arctic circle, 24 h periods of daylight in the summer are balanced by 24 h periods of night in the winter. Near the equator, the constancy of 12 h days throughout the year makes for a light environment that promotes year-round high net primary productivity and permits an agriculture that is characterized by either multiple plantings during the annual crop calendar or an abundance of perennial crops that provide a mixture or succession of harvests throughout the year.

**A** **ltitude**

As elevation increases, light intensity also increases because the thinner atmosphere absorbs and disperses less light. Plants growing at higher elevations, therefore, are more subject to conditions of light saturation and face greater danger of chlorophyll degradation than plants at sea level. Many highelevation plants have evolved reflective coloration or protective hairs or scales on leaf cuticles to reduce the amount of

light penetrating the leaves.

**T** **opography**

The slope and direction of the soil surface can create localized variations in the intensity and duration of exposure to sunlight. Although the temperature effects of this variation may be of greater significance, steep slopes facing the poles can receive significantly lower direct insolation than other sites. Slope orientation usually becomes more important during the winter months, when a hillside or other topographic feature can cast a shadow over the vegetation. In farming systems, minor topographic variation can create subtle

differences in microclimate that affect plant development, especially when plants are still very small (Figure 4.4).

**A** **ir** **Q** **uality**

Suspended materials in the atmosphere can have a significant screening effect. Smoke, dust, and other pollutants, either natural or human produced, can greatly interfere with photosynthetic activity, either by reducing the amount of light energy that reaches the leaf or by coating the leaf and cutting down the amount of light that penetrates the cuticle. Such air quality problems are usually most common in and around urban or industrial regions (Figure 4.5), but poor air quality associated with agricultural activities such a burning and soil disturbance can also occur. Greenhouse horticulture

is particularly affected by deposition of particulates from dirty air; even when glass is clean it reduces light passage by about 13%.

**V** **egetation** **C** **anopy** **S** **tructure**

The average leaf allows the transmission of about 10% of the light that strikes its surface. Depending on the structure of the canopy of the vegetation, leaves will overlap one another to a greater or lesser extent, adding to the density of the canopy and reducing both the quantity and quality of light that eventually reaches the soil surface. At the same time, however, considerable sunlight may pass between leaves or through the spaces that become available between leaves as wind moves the canopy and as the sun moves across the sky. Some of this additional light enters as diffused side lighting

Light **47**

determining the potential for light absorption of a particular canopy is to measure **leaf area index** (LAI). This is done by calculating the total surface area of leaves above a certain area of ground; since the units for both are identical (m [2] ), LAI becomes a unitless measure of the amount of cover. If

the LAI is determined to be 3.5, for example, the given area is covered by the equivalent of 3.5 layers of leaves in the canopy, implying that light will have to travel through that many layers before reaching the ground. The height of each layer, however, is an important determinant of the sequential reduction of light as it travels through the canopy.

**FIGURE 4.5** **Smog in the Valley of Mexico.** The high level of air pollution in this mountain-ringed valley impacts light quality at ground level. One of the peaks of Volcán Ixtacihuatl extends above the smog.

(sky light), and other light enters directly from the sun and forms sunflecks (small, usually mobile spots of unobstructed light). From an agricultural perspective, it is important to understand how light varies inside of the vegetative canopy, especially when dealing with diverse intercropped systems, agroforestry systems, and even the management of noncrop plant species in the interior of a cropping system.

The **relative rate of light transmission** of a canopy is expressed as the average amount of light that is able to penetrate the canopy as a percentage of the total incident light available at the top of the canopy or on the surface of an adjacent area free of vegetation. Since we also know that the change in average light penetration depends on the density of the foliage and arrangement of leaves, another way of

Not only is the more obvious measure of total light intensity reduced as we enter deeper into the vegetative cover, but the quality of that light changes as well. The “light of shade” inside an agroecosystem (or forest) usually has a very low amount of red and blue light, and a relatively high amount of green and IR light. This effect is particularly pronounced under broad-leaved evergreen canopies. Conifer forests, on the other hand, have much more red and blue light at the forest floor because of the structure of the leaves (needles) and the fact that they are much more reflective rather than absorbing and transmitting of visible light.

Given the extreme variations in canopy structure among natural vegetations and cropping systems, light levels inside canopies are highly variable as well. They can range from only a few percent of full sunlight at soil level in a dense forest to nearly 100% of full sunlight in a cropping system in the early stages of crop development. The light intensity in a fully mature cotton crop is reduced to 30% of full sunlight at a point halfway between canopy top and soil surface, and is less than 5% of full sunlight at the soil surface. The ways in which a squash crop, a corn crop, and a corn/squash intercrop modify the light environment under their canopies are illustrated in Figure 4.6.

**FIGURE 4.6** **Light attenuation under the canopy of a squash monoculture, a corn monoculture, and a corn/squash intercrop.** The data for each crop show the percentage of full sunlight remaining at each of six horizontal levels.

**PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATE**

Once light is absorbed by the leaf and activates the processes in the chloroplast that eventually lead to the production of energy-rich sugars, differences in the actual rate of photosynthesis become important. Photosynthetic rate is primarily determined by three different sets of factors: (1) the plant’s developmental stage (discussed in the next section), (2) the environmental conditions surrounding the plant, including the light environment, and (3) the type of photosynthetic pathway (C3, C4, or crassulacean acid metabolism [CAM]) used by the plant. It is important to know what determines variations in photosynthetic rate when managing the light environment in agroecosystems.

**P** **hotosynthetic** **E** **fficiency** **and**

**F** **actors** **of** **the** **E** **nvironment**

Like any plant response, photosynthesis is greatly affected by environmental conditions. These include temperature, light intensity, light quality, duration of light exposure, availability of carbon dioxide, availability of moisture, and wind. For each of these factors, a plant has maximum and minimum tolerances, as well as an optimum condition making photosynthesis most effective. The effects of these factors will be dealt with in more detail in later chapters.

In general it can be said that much of an individual plant’s structure and function has evolved over time for photosynthetic efficiency. But despite a host of adaptations, from leaf structure to chemical pathways, only a small percentage of available solar energy is captured by the process. Most leaves reach saturation at only about 20% of full sunlight. Of the solar energy absorbed by leaves, only about 20% gets converted to chemical energy in sugar molecules. This gives photosynthesis a theoretical efficiency of about 4%, which can be lowered even more as carbon dioxide around the leaf

is depleted. In addition, only part of the energy in photosynthate is actually converted to biomass, reducing the efficiency of the entire process to between 1% and 3%. Since we have yet to find ways of altering the photosynthetic process itself, it becomes most important to try to maintain environmental conditions as close to optimum as possible, as well as to select crop plants with the appropriate pathway and adaptations for a particular environment.

**D** **ifferences** **in** **P** **hotosynthetic** **P** **athways**

The research that has helped us understand the different types of photosynthetic pathways and their conditions of optimum functioning has also helped us refine our selection of crops for different locations. The higher photosynthetic rates, virtual lack of photorespiration, and morphological adaptations (bundle sheaths) in C4 plants combine to give these plants an advantage under conditions of high light intensity and warm temperatures. These two conditions often occur in moisturelimited situations as well. Therefore, even under moisture stress and accompanying stomatal closure, C4 plants can

continue to photosynthesize through the scavenging of internally produced carbon dioxide because of an ability to maintain the process even at low compensation points for carbon dioxide. C4 plants, however, are somewhat restricted to these conditions of high light intensity and warmth. C3 plants have a much wider distribution and a better ability to function under conditions of lower temperatures, shading, and climatic variation. Researchers have recently shown that when C3 and C4 crops (e.g., corn and dry beans, or sweet sorghum and soybeans) are grown together in the same cropping system, the complementarity in light needs helps produce a yield advantage for the mixture (Tsubo et al. 2001; Arshad and Ranumukhaarachichi 2012). Rotations of C3 and C4 crops can also respond to changing light conditions that occur seasonally.

**M** **easurement** **of** **P** **hotosynthetic** **R** **ate**

The measurement of photosynthetic rates in the field allows us to monitor the efficiency of energy capture in various crops. The most accurate measurement is of actual gas exchange by the plant. An individual leaf, plant part, or whole plant is enclosed in a transparent chamber where conditions are monitored and maintained as close to ambient conditions as

possible. Air is passed through the chamber and into an IR gas analyzer (IRGA) so that changes in carbon dioxide content caused by the photosynthesis–respiration balance can be determined.

The other form of measurement is based on the weight gain in dry biomass by the whole plant or the determination of the correlation between weight gain of specific plant parts and the whole plant over time. For an annual plant that begins as a seed and completes its life cycle in a single season, net photosynthetic activity is directly related to the dry weight of the plant at harvest. For perennials, some part of the plant has to be harvested, and by using models of whole plant development and biomass distribution, approximate values of net photosynthetic activity can be determined. The LAI described earlier can also be used to estimate the potential leaf area available for photosynthesis in a crop system, and then based on our knowledge of approximate photosynthetic rates for individual plants or plant parts, estimates of the photosynthetic rate for the whole system can be made.

**OTHER FORMS OF RESPONSE TO LIGHT**

Plants respond to light in other ways besides using light to produce energy-rich sugars. Light has an influence on the plant from germination of the seed to its production of new seeds.

**G** **ermination**

The seeds of many plants require light to germinate; when buried beneath the soil they do poorly. A single, brief exposure to light, however, such as during cultivation when a weed seed is brought to the surface but immediately buried again

Light **49**

as the soil is turned, can be enough to induce germination. Other seeds need repeated exposure or even constant exposure to the light in order to germinate. Lettuce is perhaps one of the best known examples of such a crop species—without light exposure, germination is reduced by 70% or more. The seeds of other plants, such as those of many of the cucurbits, have the opposite requirement: the seed must be buried fully in order to germinate because light actually inhibits germination. In all of these cases, a light-sensitive hormone controls the response.

**G** **rowth** **and** **D** **evelopment**

Once a seed germinates, the newly emerged plant begins the process of growth and development. At any stage in the process, light intensity or duration of light exposure can control the plant’s response, either as a stimulus for the response or as a limiting factor.

**Establishment**

Early seedling establishment can be very much affected by light levels, especially when seed germination or seedling establishment takes place under the canopy of already established plants. Some seedlings are less shade tolerant than others, and have more difficulty establishing when there is a lack of sufficient light to maintain further plant development. An example of the importance of differences in shade tolerance is seen in the comparison of seedlings of white pine and sugar maple in forests of the northeastern United States. White pine seedlings experience a photosynthetic deficit at 10% of full sunlight and sugar maple seedlings reach it at 3%. This difference in light compensation point means that sugar maple is more shade tolerant than white pine, so in a dense forest with light levels consistently below 10%, only sugar maple seedlings will reproduce. The greater shade tolerance of sugar maple can be an important factor in forest succession. After logging, pines establish first, but as the forest closes in and shade deepens, sugar maples begin to establish and eventually replace the pines. This successional process has been extremely important for maple syrup producers in the region. Without ever having to plant a sugar maple seedling, an entire industry has emerged.

**Plant Growth**

When a plant is surrounded by others, the amount of light reaching its leaves can become limiting and competition for light begins to occur. Competition for light is especially likely in same-species plant populations or in plant communities made up of very similar species with very similar light needs. Stem and leaf growth can be severely limited if competition reaches the point where a plant is completely shaded by its neighbors. If some part of the plant is able to emerge from the shade and reach full sunlight, photosynthesis in that part may be able to compensate for the shading occurring over the rest of the plant and permit adequate development.

Many plants develop anatomically different leaves depending on the level of shading or sun. Shade leaves are

thinner and have larger surface per unit weight, a thinner epidermis, less photosynthetic pigment, spongier leaf structure, but more stomata than sun leaves. Interestingly, shade leaves often appear to be adapted to the lower light environment, being able to photosynthesize above the compensation point due in part to the larger surface area for light capture. But it is important that shade leaves be protected from the harmful effects of too much light.

**Phototropism** Light can induce a plant to synthesize chlorophyll and anthocyanins, which stimulate growth in certain plant parts such as the leaf petiole or the flower peduncle, causing the phenomenon of growing toward or away from light. In some cases, this growth pattern is triggered by a hormone that is activated by blue light. Leaves can be oriented toward the sun to capture more light, or away from the sun in high-light environments. Sunflowers receive their name from the characteristic orientation of the disk of the inflorescence toward the morning sun.

**Photoperiod** Because the earth is tilted on its axis, the relative proportion of daylight and nighttime hours varies from one time of year to another. Because of the correlation of hours of light or dark with other climatic factors, especially temperature, plants have developed adaptive responses to the changing light/dark regimes over time. Important processes such as flowering, seed germination, leaf drop, and pigmentation changes are examples. A pigment in plants known as phytochrome is the major photoreceptive agent responsible for regulating these

responses.

The phytochrome pigment has two forms; one form has an absorption peak for red light with a wavelength of 660 nm, the other has an absorption peak for far-red light with a wavelength of 730 nm. In daylight, the red light form is rapidly converted to the far-red form, and in the dark, the far-red form slowly converts back to the red form. The farred phytochrome is biologically active and responsible for the basic responses of plants to the number of hours of light or darkness.

In the morning, after only a few minutes of light exposure, the far-red phytochrome becomes the dominant form and remains so throughout the day. This dominance is maintained into the night as well, since the conversion back to red phytochrome during darkness is slow. Therefore, when the length of the night is relatively short, there is insufficient time for enough far-red phytochrome to convert to the red form, and the far-red form stays dominant. However, as the number of hours of darkness increases, a point is reached at which night is long enough to allow a shift of dominance to the red form. Even when this period of red dominance is short, changes occur in the plant’s response.

In chrysanthemums, for example, the end of the far-red phytochrome’s continual dominance in autumn triggers the growth of flowering buds. This type of response is known as a “short-day” response, even though the actual response

**50** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

is activated by the longer nighttime hours. The importance of the dark period is accentuated by the fact that even a short period of artificial light in the middle of the night for greenhouse-raised mums allows for the conversion of enough far-red phytochrome to suppress flowering.

Strawberries have the opposite type of response. In the spring, shorter nights allow the far-red phytochrome to regain continual dominance, causing a shift from vegetative production to flower production. Plants with this kind of response are called “long-day” plants, even though it is shorter nights that actually trigger the change. So-called day-neutral varieties of strawberries have been developed to extend flowering later into the summer and early fall when normal strawberries undergo the shift to vegetative growth characteristic of long-day plants.

The conditions of the light environment have a crucial role in the production of the part of the plant that we intend to harvest. In general, crop plants have been selected to shunt a great deal of photosynthate to the portions of the plant that are harvested. In other words, the harvested portions are major “sinks” in carbon partitioning. Nevertheless, the ability of the plant to produce the desired amount of biomass in its harvested parts is dependent on the conditions of its light environment. By understanding the complex relationships between plant response and light quantity, quality, and duration of exposure as discussed earlier, the light environment can be manipulated and plants selected in order to optimize output from the agroecosystem.

**MANAGING THE LIGHT ENVIRONMENT**

**IN AGROECOSYSTEMS**

There are two main approaches to managing the light environment of an agroecosystem. Where light is generally not a limiting factor, management is oriented toward accommodating the system to the excess of light that can occur; where light is more likely to be a limiting factor, the focus is on how to make enough light available for all of the plants present in the system.

Regions where light is not a limiting factor are often dry regions. In these locations, the key issue in determining the structure of the vegetation and the organization of a cropping system is usually the availability of water, not light. Plants are usually more separated from each other, light relations are of less importance since there is usually an overabundance of solar energy, and many organisms must display adaptations for “avoidance” of light rather than capture. Leaves are often vertically oriented to avoid direct exposure to light, have less chlorophyll content so as to absorb less light energy and thus less heat, and contain higher proportions of red pigments so as to reflect the red light normally absorbed in photosynthesis.

Light is more likely to be a limiting factor in humid regions. Both natural vegetation and agroecosystems in humid areas

are much more layered or stratified, with both light quantity and quality being altered as light passes through those layers on its way to the soil surface. In these regions, the management of light can be an important factor in optimizing the productivity of agroecosystems. The more stratified the vegetation structure, the greater the challenges for light management. In forestry and agroforestry systems, for example, the seedlings of the canopy species often do not germinate well in the shaded environment of the forest floor, a factor that must be taken into account in managing the diversity of the

system.

**C** **rop** **S** **election**

One aspect of managing the light environment is to match the availability of light in the system to the plants’ response to light. The light requirements of plants, as well as their tolerances, are important factors in the crop selection process.

The type of photosynthetic pathway of the crop plants is the most basic determinant of light requirements. As discussed previously, plants with C4-type photosynthesis require high light intensity and long duration of light exposure to produce optimally, in addition to not being as well adapted to areas with cooler, moister conditions, especially cooler nighttime conditions. In contrast, many C3 plants will not grow well in the same light conditions favored by C4 plants.

In central coastal California, for example, where the adjacent cold ocean currents normally keep summer nighttime temperatures at low to moderate levels and produce regular morning fog, C4 crops such as sweet corn are very slow to develop and rarely obtain the yields or sweetness of the ears grown in plantings in the interior valleys of the state just 50 miles to the east. In contrast, many C3 crops such as lettuce grow very well in the coastal climate.

Sugar cane is a good example of a C4 crop requiring high light intensity. When planted in areas with adequate light and moisture, this C4 crop achieves one of the highest rates of photosynthetic efficiency known for crop plants. Variety selection, row arrangement, planting density, fertility management, and other factors have been combined with the 4% conversion rate of PAR to biomass to produce some of the highest net dry matter returns known for a cropping system (up to 78 tons dry matter/ha/year).

Even within crops of the same photosynthetic pathway, crop selections can be made. Different light compensation points, for example, could determine which crops to select for shadier environments.

The light environment in the interior of a cropping system varies considerably. Cropping systems can be designed to create regions in the system where the light environment is most appropriate for a particular crop. In the tropics, for example, farmers make full use of the altered light environment under the canopy of trees to grow crops such as coffee, cacao, and vanilla. Cacao and vanilla plants do not tolerate

Light **51**

direct sun for any appreciable amount of time, and often they need to have the shade-producing canopy in place before they can be planted. Only recently have varieties of coffee been developed that can be planted in direct sunlight.

In mixtures of annual crops, the light environment within the canopy of the system changes as the crop system matures, with LAI and light intensity at different levels undergoing considerable variation over time. Farmers have learned to

take advantage of these changing conditions. A well-known example is the traditional corn–bean–squash intercrop of Mesoamerica. In a particular form of this multiple cropping system in southeastern Mexico, all three crops are planted at the same time, hence each encounters a very similar light environment when they first emerge. But the corn component of the system soon dominates the canopy structure, casting shade on the beans and squash below. As the corn canopy closes, beans occupy the lower half to two-thirds of the cornstalk by climbing up the cornstalk. The squash is confined to the darker understory, itself casting yet a deeper shade on the soil surface and aiding in weed control within the cropping system. Although both the beans and squash receive less-than-optimal light exposure, they both receive enough to produce adequately and do not interfere with the very high light needs of the corn. Corn is a C4 crop, and beans and squash are C3 crops. Such an agroecosystem is evidence that crops of different photosynthetic pathways can be combined in intercropping systems, and research aimed in this direction could certainly come up with more.

Diverse home garden agroforestry systems are perhaps the most complex examples of the management of the light environment in agroecosystems; they are discussed in much more detail in Chapter 18, _Disturbance, Succession, and_ _Agroecosystem Management_ . Their high LAI (3.5–5.0), diversity of distribution of the canopy layers, high light absorbance by the foliage (90%–95%), and patchy horizontal structure due to either successional development or intentional human intervention make for a highly diverse light environment that promotes one of the correspondingly highest plant species diversities known for an agroecosystem. Much needs to be

known about the specific light requirements and tolerances of each component of such a system.

A study of the light environments of nine different agroecosystems in Mexico and Costa Rica provides some impression of the possible variation in the structure and characteristics of light environments. The data from this study are presented in Table 4.1.

In general, the polycultures in the study were more effective at intercepting light than the monocultures, although the sweet potato monoculture, with its broad leaves, intercepted light as effectively as the home garden and the shaded coffee system. These mixed results point out the difficulty of determining a system’s efficiency of light use. Simply measuring vegetative cover, LAI, and the transmission of light to the surface does not by itself elucidate how light is used by the components of the system nor does it show how a well-designed system can create a light environment that meets the needs of a diversity of different plants at the same time.

**T** **emporal** **M** **anagement**

Over time, the light environment in an agroecosystem changes. One type of change results from the growth of the plants in the system, and another from seasonal changes. Both kinds of changes can be taken advantage of, modified, or used as cues for initiating specific techniques.

One kind of temporal management that takes advantage of the changes in the light environment that occur as a crop matures is the “oversowing” of one crop into another. This is done, for example, to produce an oat/legume hay crop: instead of sowing the oats, harvesting the oats, and then planting the legume covercrop (such as clover or vetch), the seed of the legume can be sown when the oats reach a particular stage of development and the light environment is most conducive to the establishment of the legume. Specifically, the legume is planted just before the heads of oats begin to form, when light levels at 3 in. above the soil are about 40% of full sunlight. Clover seems to establish best around 50%

of full sunlight, so overseeding that occurs just before heads start to form gets the legume off to a good start. After the oats are harvested, the light levels reaching the established clover plants approach once again those of full sunlight, promoting the rapid growth of this species as a nitrogen-fixing covercrop (Figure 4.7).

Management of seasonal variations in light is common in perennial and agroforestry systems. Coffee systems in Costa Rica—the subject of considerable applied shade management research—offer a good example of this form of temporal light management (Bellow and Nair 2003; Cerdán et al. 2012). As discussed previously, coffee is typically grown under the shade of trees, often species of the leguminous genus _Erythrina_ . Although coffee is a very shade-tolerant plant, it suffers when shade becomes too dense. This is especially true during the wet-season time of the year, when relative humidity inside the coffee cropping system stays close to 100% most of the time, promoting fungal diseases that can cause coffee defoliation and fruit drop. Therefore, a common practice is to heavily prune the shade trees at the beginning of the wet season (during June) in order to allow more light into the interior, promoting drier conditions and hence a reduced chance of disease. The greater cloud cover during the wet season lessens the need for shade over the coffee.

Close to the end of the wet season (usually November or December) another less intensive pruning occurs that opens up the canopy of the plantation again, possibly promoting the development of flower buds that open later in the dry season, but also stimulating the turnover of nitrogen-rich biomass that aids the more rapid growth of the coffee plants during this period (Figure 4.8).

As was discussed in Chapter 3, a relatively small percentage of the carbon that gets fixed by photosynthesis into

carbohydrate form eventually gets transformed into biomass. For agriculture, it is the portion of that biomass that finds its “sink” in the form of harvestable, consumable, and/or marketable organic matter that is of greatest importance. All of the discussions of how the light environment can be managed to increase the size of this sink must also take into consider ation what the long-term impacts might be of harvesting and removing this biomass from the agroecosystem.

The experience of corn farmers in Puebla, Mexico offers an interesting example of how increasing the proportion of carbon partitioned into harvestable material isn’t necessarily positive. Many of the small traditional farmers of the region switched to higher-yielding “green revolution” corn varieties in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These varieties had been bred to produce more grain at the expense of biomass normally stored in other parts of the plant—especially the stems and leaves. After planting these varieties for a few years, the farmers went back to using their traditional varieties of corn. Since these farmers used animals so extensively in their farming systems (especially for cultivation and transport), and since corn stover was an important supplemental feed for the animals, the great reduction in stems and leaves from the new varieties did not allow the production of adequate animal feed. In this case, concentrating the carbon sink in grain did not take into account the sustainability of all parts of the agroecosystem.

The same process may be going on with other crops. Traditional rice varieties, for example, store over 90% of their carbon in leaves, stems, and roots, whereas new varieties have raised the portion of carbon stored in grain to well over 20% (Cassman 1994; Cassman et al. 2003). In cultures where rice straw plays important roles elsewhere in the agroecosystem, such as for building material, fuel, and feed for animals, human needs would dictate the need for care in transitioning to varieties that sacrifice some

Light **53**

forms of biomass for rice grain. Within the agroecosystem itself, we must also understand the possible impacts of this “loss” of organic matter on such ecological components as soil organic matter maintenance, soil aggregate stability, biological activity in the soil, and nutrient inputs that are essential for the long-term sustainability of the

agroecosystem.

**F** **uture** **R** **esearch**

Much work needs to be done on managing the light environment in agroecosystems. We have recently learned a lot about photosynthetic pathways, carbon partitioning, and how to raise the yield of harvestable biomass from cropping systems. But we need also to understand that agroecosystem management requires that we return as much organic matter to the system, especially to the soil, as we remove from it. The energy that is captured from the sun must contribute as much to long-term agroecosystem sustainability as it does to short-term harvests. Research on how to balance these

needs is key to developing the sustainable agroecosystems of the future.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. What are the basic differences between too much

light and too little light in terms of plant response? What are some of the ways of compensating for either extreme in the design of an agroecosystem? 2. Our understanding of the different types of pho tosynthetic pathways in plants has come mostly from basic laboratory research, but this knowledge has helped considerably in the management of the light environment in agroecosystems. What other basic research questions, greatly isolated from the field, might be of great potential significance for sustainability? 3. What are some of the most significant ways that

humans and human activities are impacting the light environment? What might the consequences be for agriculture in the future?

4. Light energy is considered to be one of our most

available and easily used sources of renewable energy. What are some of the factors that have slowed the development of better ways to take advantage of this energy source in agriculture?
