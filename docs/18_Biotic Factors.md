## 11. Biotic Factors

Abiotic factors of the environment such as light, temperature,
and mineral nutrients are not the only constituents of the
environment that impact crop plants. Just as important are
biotic factors—that is, living organisms and the conditions
created and modified by them. An insect herbivore such as a
locust, for example, can have an enormous impact on a crop
plant, as can a neighboring plant that harbors nitrogen-fixing
bacteria in its root nodules or conserves the soil moisture by
shading the soil surface.

In Chapter 8, we discussed organisms in the environment (soil biota) that might affect crop plants. We did not,
however, treat these soil organisms _as_ biotic factors; instead
we considered them among the multiple aspects of the soil
that combine to make soil a separate factor of the environment. Here in this chapter, we lay the groundwork for treating these living organisms as biotic factors in their own
right (although the primary focus will be on plants as biotic
factors).

In agroecosystems, the farmer is in a sense the organism
with the greatest impact on the environment in which crops
are grown. The farmer alters and adjusts conditions of the
physical as well as the biological environment to meet the
needs of the crop or crops. To do so sustainably, the farmer
must have an understanding of the biotic interactions of
the agroecosystem—how each member of the community
impacts the agricultural environment and alters conditions
for its neighbors.

To conceptualize biotic factors in ecological terms, we
must enter an area of overlap between autecology and synecology. Even though we begin from the perspective of the
individual organism confronting an environment made up
of various factors, we must deal with interactions between
organisms when the factors we are concerned with are biotic.
Despite their synecological origin, however, the concepts
developed in this chapter to describe these interactions can
be applied in an autecological way by considering interactions in terms of their impact on each individual organism in
the agroecosystem.

There are two basic frameworks for conceptualizing the
interactions between organisms in a community or ecosystem; each has its respective advantages. Traditionally in
ecology, interactions have been understood in terms of the
effects that two interacting organisms have on each other.
This framework is the basis for such foundational concepts
as competition and mutualism. In agroecology, however, it
is often more helpful to view interactions as deriving from
the impact that organisms have on their shared environment. Organisms remove substances from, alter, and even



add substances to the areas they occupy, in the process
changing the environmental conditions for themselves and
other organisms. Thus each biotic factor that an individual
organism faces can be understood as a modification of the
environment created by another organism. Both of these
frameworks, or perspectives, are explained in more detail in
the succeeding text.


**ORGANISM–ORGANISM PERSPECTIVE**


A broadly accepted system for classifying interactions
between organisms was developed by E. P. Odum (1971).
This system has many useful applications and has served
ecologists well in understanding the biotic environment.
Interactions between two organisms of different species are
seen as having either a negative effect (−), a positive effect
(+), or a neutral effect (0) for each member in the interaction. For example, in the interaction classified as mutualism,
both organisms are impacted positively (+ +). The degree to
which the interaction is positive or negative for each organism depends on the level of interdependence and the level of
intensity of the interaction.

In this scheme, there is an important distinction between
situations in which both members of the mixture are present together and the interaction is actually taking place, and
situations in which the two are separate, or together and not
interacting. In Table 11.1, the “not interacting” column shows
the results in this latter situation and gives an indication of
the degree of dependence or need for interaction that each
member may have developed over evolutionary time.

The interaction that has probably received the greatest
attention, especially in the design of industrial agroecosystems, is **competition** (− −). Competition occurs in an environment where resources are in limited supply for both members
of the relationship. Even though one member of the mixture
may end up dominating the other, both do worse when they
are interacting in this way than if there had been no interaction at all. The organisms interact by removing something
from the environment that they both need. Two crop varieties
of the same species, for example, are highly likely to compete
in a resource-limited environment such as a crop field with
low nitrogen levels in the soil.

When two organisms have become so dependent on
each other that they suffer when not in interaction, then it
can be said that the interaction is a **mutualism** (+ +). Both
organisms depend upon the way in which the other modifies the environment for both. Some interactions between
legumes and _Rhizobium_ bacteria, for example, are thought

**Types of Two-Species Interactions as Defined by Odum**



**Interacting**



**Not**

**Interacting**



In the two remaining types of interactions, one organism is negatively impacted by the actions of the other (+ −).
The perpetrator of the actions generally has an obligate relationship with the other, whereas the organism receiving the
brunt of the negative impacts does better if left alone (i.e.,
the relationship becomes − 0). In **parasitism**, one organism
(the parasite) feeds on another (the host), but the host is rarely
killed outright. The parasite may live together with the host
for a long period, with the host eventually surviving, but its
fitness is reduced. Some parasites, known as parasitoids,
cause the death of the host (e.g., parasitic wasps in the genus
_Trichogramma_ ); we take advantage of such interactions for
biological control in agroecosystems. **Predation** is a much
more direct interaction, where one organism actually kills
and consumes another. We depend greatly on predation by
certain beneficial organisms for the management of pests in
farming systems.

This classification scheme is very useful for distinguishing the types of interactions that are observed in most natural
environments. But it focuses on the end result of each type of
interaction, rather than on the mechanisms involved as the
interaction takes place.


**ORGANISM–ENVIRONMENT–ORGANISM**

**PERSPECTIVE**


Each of the interactions described above can be understood

alternatively as the result of one organism modifying the
environment in a way that impacts the other organism in the
interaction. By focusing on how the environment mediates
the effects that organisms have on each other, it is possible to
understand the _mechanisms_ through which the effects occur.
With knowledge of the mechanisms, the agroecosystem
manager is in a much better position to manipulate or take
advantage of the interactions.

When an organism modifies the environment in some way
that impacts another organism, that modification is termed
an **interference** . Interferences can be divided into two types:


  - In a **removal interference**, one organism removes

something from the environment, reducing the
availability of that resource for other organisms.

  - In an **addition interference**, one organism adds

something to the environment that can have a positive, negative, or neutral impact on other organisms.


Usually only one or the other of these interferences takes
place in a particular interaction, but they can occur together
in some interactions, as discussed in the following. When
conceptualized with this framework, an interaction between
two or more organisms is composed of an impact on the
environment (an addition or a removal) perpetrated by one
organism (and in some cases an additional impact created
by the other organism), followed by a response on the part of
both organisms to the resulting changes in the environment.
Note that the “environment” is not necessarily external to

to be mutualistic: neither organism does as well alone as
they do together.

When an interaction benefits both members, but neither is
negatively impacted in the absence of interaction, the interaction is termed **protocooperation** (+ +). Pollination can be
an example of such an interaction: when there are several
species of pollinating insects available and many species of
nectar-producing plants, one species of pollinator and one
species of plant benefit each other if they interact, but neither
is harmed if they don’t interact. Both mutualism and protocooperation are considered examples of **symbiosis**, a term
formed from the Greek words for “living together”.

When one organism maintains or provides a condition
necessary for the welfare of another but does not affect its
own well-being by doing so, the interaction (+ 0) is termed
**commensalism** . The assisted organism suffers, though,
when the organism creating the needed conditions is not
present. A shade tree species in a cacao agroforestry system,
for example, creates the reduction in light intensity needed by
the obligate shade-loving cacao plants below, but the shade
tree does equally as well with the cacao present or not.

When one species negatively affects another, but is not
directly affected itself, then the interaction is termed an
**amensalism** (− 0). An example of an amensal interaction is
when a plant releases a chemical from its leaves in raindrip
that can negatively impact other plants around it, but which
does not impact the producer of the chemical. Such a process
is a form of allelopathy, which will be discussed below in
more detail. An example of this kind of amensalism is the
relationship between the black walnut ( _Juglans nigra_ ) and
almost any plant that attempts to grow under the canopy of a
black walnut. Chemicals leached from the husks, leaves, and
root exudates of black walnut are toxic to most plants.

the interacting organisms—it can include the tissues or body
of either or both organisms. Types of removal and addition
interferences are described in greater detail in the succeeding text and summarized in Table 11.2.


**R** **emoval** **I** **nterferences**


When one organism removes something from the environment as part of its life activities or interaction with other
organisms, it can affect other organisms. This type of interference is generally negative for one or more members of the
interaction, but it can have positive effects as well. There are
several types of removal interferences in agroecosystems.


**Competition**
Only a shift of emphasis is needed to understand competition as a removal interference. Competition occurs when two
organisms are removing a resource from the environment—
such as light, nitrogen, or water—that is not abundant
enough to meet the needs of both. Many of the earlier
chapters in this book have described the conditions under
which resources may become limiting and thus set the stage
for competition.

Viewing competition as a removal interference provides an
alternative way of understanding what is commonly thought
of as competition for space. Under this framework, “space”
is seen as a complex mixture of resources that is impacted by
the removal effects of the organisms that occupy that space;
thus organisms are in competition over the resources of the
space, not the space itself.

Competition between individuals of the same species—
**intraspecific competition** —can be quite intense since the
needs of the interacting individuals are so similar. Mono­
culture agriculture has invested much energy in determining how densely crops can be planted without competition
between individual plants negatively affecting production.



Competition between individuals of different species,
called **interspecific competition**, can also be important
when levels of resources are not sufficient to meet the needs
of both. The mechanisms of the interaction involve either

removal of a resource or its direct protection or sequestration
by an organism (e.g., when an animal defends a territory and
its resources). In either case the resource is the primary focus
of the interaction.


Competition is a very important concept in ecology, but it
also has a history of controversy and discussion. On the one
hand, interspecific competition is a cornerstone of evolutionary ecology. Competition is considered the engine of natural
selection and a force with which all organisms must contend
in their struggle to survive and leave offspring. Interestingly,
however, ecologists also see that _avoiding_ competition can
actually be advantageous for a species, and that doing so
has probably played a key role in the development of species
diversity.

Without actually studying the mechanisms of interference
that are involved in competition, and identifying the removal
process from the environment that leads to it, we can only
assume that competition occurs. Agroecosystem management requires a more detailed determination of competitive
interactions; otherwise the farmer is left with no other option
but to overload the system with excess resources.


**Parasitism**

As described earlier, parasitism is an interaction in which two
organisms live together, with one (the parasite) deriving its
nourishment from the tissues of the other (the host) without
killing it. In interference terms, the environment from which
removal takes place is the body of the host. Parasites are
physiologically dependent on their hosts, live much shorter
lives, and have a high reproductive potential.

The relationship between mistletoe and various species
of trees is an example of this kind of removal interference.


**134** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems


herbivory damages a part of the crop that is intended to be
harvested and sent to market, the product’s sale value may
be reduced.



**FIGURE 11.1** **Parasitic mistletoe on a guava tree, Monteverde,**
**Costa Rica.** The guava branch is so heavily infested by the parasite
that only the red-orange flowers of the mistletoe are visible.


The mistletoe plant actually penetrates and taps into the vascular system of the host tree, drawing its water and nutrients from the host. If the parasite becomes too abundant on
the host tree, the tree is stunted and often deformed, and
can become subject to debilitating attacks from other pests
(Figure 11.1). Farm and range animals are especially susceptible to parasites; these include ticks that attach externally to
the host, screwworm flies that lay eggs in the flesh of the animal, and stomach parasites ranging from bacteria to worms.

Under natural conditions, parasitism probably represents
something of a compromise between the host and the parasite. They have evolved together over time, with the host
being tolerant of a constant low-grade infection, and the parasite depending on the continuity of the host’s life for its own
reproductive success. In agricultural situations, however—
especially the human-maintained conditions of concentrated
monocultures—heavy parasite loads become a serious form
of disease that puts the entire crop or herd at risk of developing secondary diseases and dying.


**Herbivory**
The interference relationship between an herbivore and the
plant it consumes—like that of parasite and host—is a very
direct one, with plant tissue being the part of the environment that is removed. Beyond the scope of the individual
plant, however, herbivory is a removal interference in an even
broader sense in that biomass and its associated nutrients are

removed from the environment. The consumption of plant
material reduces the return of biomass to the soil, and if the
removal is too intense and takes place over an extended time
frame, it can lead to depletion of nutrients in the system.

From an agricultural perspective, herbivory can have
three types of negative impacts. First, herbivory removes
photosynthetic surface area that may be of importance in the
development of the crop plant. Second, if the plant part that
is consumed were going to return to the soil as crop residue,
herbivory is reducing this input to the system. Third, if the



The effects of herbivory, however, are not always negative. In some pasture or range situations, for example,
grazing can be beneficial to the productivity of the forage
species. Removal of excessive plant material can stimulate
the production of new biomass, or even allow certain plant
species that are suppressed by old or excessive plant cover
to germinate or become more predominant in the pasture
mixture. The evolutionary role of such removal interference
has been well documented for the Serengeti plains in Africa
(McNaughton 1985), where it has been shown that the highest productivity and species diversity of both plants and animals have developed under cyclical patterns of multispecies
grazing. Good range managers know that periodic rotational
grazing promotes the most production in pasture systems.

In natural systems as well, herbivory plays an important
role in removing excess biomass, directing energy flow, and
recycling nutrients. These processes have the potential for
playing important and positive roles in agroecosystems, but
humans have tended to view herbivory as wholly negative, a
constant challenge to be overcome. Further research needs to
be focused on how the pressure of this removal interference
can be directed away from the economically valuable parts
of the agroecosystem and concentrated in parts that stimulate
other components of the system in ways that contribute to
sustainability.


**A** **ddition** **I** **nterferences**


Many organisms in the course of their daily life processes
add something to the environment that impacts associated
organisms. These impacts can be negative, such as when the
addition causes a reduction in growth or development for the
associated organisms, or when it excludes them from the area
entirely. In other cases, the impact of the addition interference
can be positive for the associated organisms, as when they use
the added substance or material to improve their own standing
in the community, or when the exclusion of intolerant organisms from the habitat allows them to occupy it. Ultimately,
associated organisms benefiting from the addition may
develop a dependence on the organism making the addition,
creating a relationship of coexistence or even of symbiosis.


**Epiphytism**
When one organism lives on the body of another without
drawing any nutrition from it, an addition interference is
occurring because the host is adding a physical structure to
the environment that is providing another organism with a
habitat. When the two organisms are plants and the habitat
is a trunk or stem, the perched plant is called an **epiphyte** ;
when the habitat is a leaf, it is called an **epiphyll** . In Odum’s
terms, epiphytism is a form of commensalism.

Epiphytes and epiphylls do not obtain water or food from
the supporting plant, nor do they have connections to the
soil. Water is derived from precipitation, and nutrients from


Biotic Factors **135**


the positive effects of the interaction are realized. Honeybees
visit a wide range of plant species, most of which are visited
by other pollinators as well, making the relationship between
the honeybee and any particular plant species nonobligatory. In many agricultural landscapes, however, the dramatic
reduction in biotic diversity that has accompanied the expansion of monocultures, heavy use of pesticides, and fencerowto-fencerow farming has created an artificial dependence on
honey bees that are raised by beekeepers and transported in
hives to the crop fields during pollination time.

wind-borne particles, the decay of the supporting plant’s
bark, and minerals and organic compounds dissolved in
raindrip. Most epiphytic plants face frequent drought conditions in their aerial environment, even in the moist habitats
where they are most common. Algae, lichens, mosses and a
few ferns are the most common epiphytes in cold and wet
environments; a wide variety of vascular plants have evolved
the epiphytic lifestyle in warm and wet climates, especially
ferns and species belonging to the families Bromeliaceae and
Orchidaceae. A large number of species in these two families
have taken on considerable economic importance in horticulture and floriculture, and are raised on artificial perches in
greenhouses and lathhouses for commercial sale.

An epiphytic plant of considerable economic importance
in agriculture in several tropical countries is vanilla ( _Vanilla_
_fragrans_ ). Vanilla produces long whitish aerial adventitious
roots at each leaf that adhere firmly appressed to the trunk or
branches of the host plant. Sometimes roots climb down the
trunk to the ground, but only ramify in the humus or mulch
layer. Capsule-like fruits up to 25 cm long (called beans in
the trade) form on the aerial stems, and are dependent on
hand pollination for successful formation in many parts of
the world into which the crop has been introduced from its
native Mesoamerica (Figure 11.2).


**Symbioses**
When two organisms make additions to the environment they
share so as to benefit each other, they form a symbiotic relationship. If the relationship is nonobligatory and nonessential
for the survival of either organism, the resulting relationship
is called **protocooperation** . An example of protocooperation is the relationship between the European honeybee ( _Apis_
_mellifera_ ) and the plants it pollinates. The plant a bee visits
is adding pollen and nectar to the environment, serving to
attract the pollinator. The actual gathering of the nectar or
honey by the bee is a removal interference, but then the pollen is added back into the environment when the bee deposits
it onto the stigma of another flower—this is the point at which



When the organisms benefiting each other through addition interferences become dependent on each other for optimal performance and even survival, then the relationship is a
**mutualism** . A good example of mutualism is the relationship
between certain soil-dwelling fungi and their vascular-plant
associates. The fungi are made up of **mycorrhizae**, special
compound structures that can form connections with plant
roots. The mycorrhizae allow the root to provide sugars for
the fungus, and the fungus in return to provide water and
minerals to the plant. There are two types of mycorrhizae:
(a) _ectotrophic_, in which the fungal mycelium forms a dense
mantle covering the surface of the root, with many hyphae
that extend outward into the soil, and others that extend
inward and force themselves between the cells of the epidermis and cortex of the root (very common in the Pinaceae);
and (b) _endotrophic_, the most common type, in which there
is no surface mantle but instead some of the hyphae actually
inhabit the protoplasts of parenchymatous tissues and extend
outward into the soil (common in most flowering plant families, especially important crop species such as corn, beans,
apples, and strawberries).

Another important example of a mutualism is the relationship between legumes (plants in the Fabaceae family) and
_Rhizobium_ bacteria. The bacteria enter the root tissue of a
legume plant, causing the tissue to form nodules in which
the bacteria live and reproduce. The nodules, formed from
root tissue, represent an addition interference on the part
of the legume plant. The legume also provides the bacteria with sugars. The bacteria’s addition interference comes
in the form of fixed (useable) nitrogen, which the bacteria
produce from atmospheric nitrogen. The legume would be
greatly handicapped in its growth without the fixed nitrogen
provided by the bacteria, and the bacteria require the root
nodules for optimal growth and reproduction. The fixing of
nitrogen by _Rhizobia_ is one of the most important means by
which nitrogen is moved from the vast atmospheric reservoir
into soil and biomass (Figure 11.3).

As we will see in later chapters, such beneficial mutualisms, where two or more members of the relationship
interact through addition interference, are of major importance in the design and management of many intercropping

agroecosystems.


**Allelopathy**

A form of interference that has received considerable atten
tion recently, especially in agriculture, is **allelopathy**
(Gliessman 2002a; Ren Sen et al. 2008; Cheema et al. 2013).


**136** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems


In agroecosystems, allelopathy may play important roles in
biological control, the design of intercropping systems, and
crop rotation management. Examples are presented in the
following and in more detail in later chapters.

**FIGURE 11.3** **Nodules on the roots of fava beans.** The nodules

association with the legume.


Allelopathy is the production of a compound by a plant that
when released into the environment has an inhibitory or
stimulatory impact on other organisms. Allelopathic interactions have been shown to occur in a wide variety of natural
ecosystems and agroecosystems.

Allelopathic compounds are natural products that may be
direct metabolites, by-products of other metabolic pathways,
or breakdown products of compounds or biomass. The compounds are often toxic to the plant that produces them if they
are not stored in some nontoxic form or released before they
build up internally to toxic levels. In some cases, even when
the toxins are released from the plant, they may build up
in the immediate environment and become toxic to the plant
that produced them. Allelopathic compounds take many
forms, from water soluble to volatile, simple to complex, and
persistent to very short lived. The most common allelopathic
compounds fall into such chemical groups as tannins, phenolic acids, terpenes, and alkaloids.

Allelopathic products are released from the plant in a variety of ways. They can be washed off of green leaves, leached
out of dry leaves, volatilized from the leaves, exuded from
roots, or released from shed plant material during decomposition. Even flowers, fruits, and seeds can be sources of
allelopathic toxins. There are also cases in which products do
not become toxic until they have been altered once they are
in the environment, either by normal chemical degradation
or through decomposition by microorganisms.

In natural ecosystems, allelopathy may help explain some
important phenomena:


  - The dominance of a single species or group of spe
cies over others;

  - Successional change and species replacement, or

the maintenance of a deflected stage in the successional process;

  - Reduced ecosystem productivity;

  - Unique patterning or distribution of plant species in

the environment.



Table 11.2 provides a brief summary of the most salient characteristics of each type of interference. Study of this table may
reveal that the grouping of interferences into addition interferences and removal interferences does not exhaust they ways in
which interferences can be classified. Mutualism, for example,
shares with competition the property of involving symmetrical
roles; that is, the organism creating the interference is simultaneously the organism receiving the interference created by the
other interacting organism (note that this symmetry does not
necessarily extend to the _results_ of the interaction). As another
example, parasitism and epiphytism both involve interferences
that act directly on one organism’s body rather than on the
external, physical environment. These observations suggest
that interferences may be grouped as either direct or indirect,
and as either symmetrical or asymmetrical. Allelopathy, for
example, is asymmetrical and indirect. Table 11.3 shows the
typology resulting from such a classification. Most forms of
interference occupy only one cell in the matrix, but protocooperation and mutualism can be either direct or indirect.


**I** **nterferences** **at** **W** **ork** **in** **A** **groecosystems**


In most multiple-species interactions, plants are removing
and adding things to the environment simultaneously. It is
very difficult to separate removal and addition interactions,
much less show how they may interact in ways that determine
which species and how many individuals of each are able to
coexist in a specific habitat. Ultimately, the combination of
interference types is going to play an important role in determining the structure and function of the ecosystem.

It is easy to imagine how allelopathy and competition,
for example, can both play a part in a polyculture cropping
system. The members of the mixture are simultaneously
adding materials to and removing resources from the environment, modifying the microclimatic conditions of that

environment at the same time, and interacting with each
other in ways that permit coexistence or favor mutualistic
interdependence. It is important, though, to understand the
mechanisms of each interaction, beginning with the impacts
of each species on the environment in which they all occur.
The ability of farmers to successfully manage complex crop
mixtures and rotations depends on the development of this
understanding.


**ALLELOPATHIC MODIFICATION**

**OF THE ENVIRONMENT**


Ecological research has placed the greatest emphasis on
competitive interactions. This has been especially true in
agronomy, where great efforts have been made to understand
what the conditions of the environment are that limit optimal
crop development, and what kinds of inputs or technologies
are needed to correct the situation when something that the
crop needs is missing or in short supply. Crop arrangements
and densities have been researched and developed to avoid
the effects of competition.

Allelopathy provides a different approach to applying
our knowledge of ecological interactions to agriculture. The
growing desire to replace synthetic chemical inputs to agroecosystems with naturally produced materials has spurred
a burst in applied research on allelopathy, especially in
Europe, India, and China (see e.g., Ren Sen 2008; Leicach
et al. 2009). Allelopathy thus serves as an excellent example
of how a research focus on the mechanisms of interference—

particularly those based on plants adding compounds to the
environment that can impact other plants—can have important applications in agroecology. Because allelopathy has
such potential importance in agroecological research and for
sustainability, the remainder of this chapter will be devoted
to exploring it in greater detail.

There are many possible allelopathic effects of weed and
crop species that need to be taken into account in agroecosystem management. The production and release of phytotoxic
chemicals can originate from crops or weeds, and they can
play very important roles in crop selection, weed management, crop rotations, the use of covercrops, and intercropping
design. Many examples of such interactions have appeared in
the international publication _Allelopathy Journal._

Our purpose in this section is to gain more insight into the
actual mechanisms of allelopathic interactions. The implications and applications of these interactions will be more fully
explored in Chapter 14.


**D** **emonstrating** **A** **llelopathy**


In order for allelopathy to be fully implicated in an interference interaction, the following steps must be followed.


1. Determine the presence of a potential allelopathic

compound in the suspected plant and plant part.
A screening system that employs some type of bioassay is a common procedure for doing this test



(Leather and Einhellig 1986). A positive bioassay
can only be used to imply that there is a potentially
allelopathically active chemical present in the
plant.
2. Show that the compounds are released from the

donor plant.
3. Determine that the compounds accumulate or con
centrate to toxic levels in the environment.

4. Show that uptake or absorption of the compounds

by the target organism takes place.
5. Demonstrate that inhibition (or stimulation) of the

target species takes place in the field.
6. Identify the chemical compounds and determine the

actual physiological basis for the response.
7. Finally, determine how the allelopathic compound

interacts with other factors in the environment so as

to either reduce or enhance its effect. (Rarely does
an allelopathic compound kill another organism
outright.)


Under ideal situations, all of these steps could be carried out
before attempting to manage allelopathy in an agroecosystem setting. But most of the time, such intensity of research
is not possible, and farmers are faced with the need to make
decisions on their farms every day. Astute observation, coupled with research results, can make allelopathy one more
tool for managing the farm environment for the benefit of
the crop.


**A** **llelopathic** **E** **ffects** **of** **W** **eeds**


Weeds are responsible for the loss of crop production all
over the world. The literature abounds with reports on the
“competitive effects” of weeds, but only relatively recently
has allelopathy been considered or even mentioned as one
of the mechanisms by which weeds impact crops, pasture plants, or native species (Colvin and Gliessman 2011).
Whenever weeds and crops are in the same planting together,
many possible forms of interference are going to be working together or in sequence. The allelopathic potential of a
large number of weed species has been known or suspected
for some time (Putnam and Weston 1986), but more recent
research on the invasive weed Eurasian spotted knapweed
( _C. maculosa_ ) has provided a foundation for understanding
in some detail the mechanisms of release of the potentially
phytotoxic compounds into the environment by weeds, how
they are taken up by associated plant species, how inhibition
actually occurs, and how the negative impacts of the compounds might be ameliorated (Bais et al. 2003).

Allelopathic chemicals released by weeds can directly
influence crop seed germination and emergence, crop growth
and development, and the health of associated crop symbionts
in the soil. Recent research on weed allelopathy has shown
that many weeds use multiple mechanisms to inhibit crop
growth and development, and such knowledge is an important component in developing alternative weed management
strategies (Leicach et al. 2009).

**SPECIAL TOPIC: HISTORY OF THE STUDY OF ALLELOPATHY**

The effects of allelopathy have been observed since the times of the Greeks and Romans, when Theophrastus suggested
that the “odors” of cabbage caused vine plants to “wilt and retreat” (Willis 1985). Japanese sources dating back to at least
the 1600s independently document what we now know to be allelopathic interactions, and such knowledge may have
developed earlier and independently in other areas.

In Europe, scientific observations of allelopathic plant interactions were not made until the seventeenth century, when
A. P. de Candolle published an influential work describing his observations of the excretion of droplets of some sort from
the roots of _Lolium temulentum_ . De Candolle believed that plants used their roots as excretory organs and that these
excretions contained chemicals that stayed in the soil and affected subsequent plant growth. His theory fell out of favor,
however, when Justus von Liebig developed the theory of mineral nutrition, and the focus on plant interactions shifted
to nutrient depletion and competition.

It was not until the late nineteenth century that careful experiments in the United States and England scientifically
demonstrated that allelopathy was an important plant interaction. In England, certain grasses were found to negatively
impact the growth of nearby trees, and the research indicated that the effects could not have been due to soil nutrient
depletion. In fact, leachates of soil from pots planted with the grasses impacted the trees as much as the grass itself. In
the United States, Schreiner and his associates published a series of papers between 1907 and 1911 documenting the
“exhaustion” of soils planted continually in one crop and the extraction of the chemicals responsible for the exhaustion. This was the first time researchers demonstrated the ability of plant chemicals to inhibit germination and seedling
growth of a plant species.

During the 1920s some important work focused on the black walnut. Cook documented the tree’s ability to inhibit
nearby plants, and Massey found that an extract of walnut bark in water caused tomato plants to wilt.

In 1937, the term _allelopathy_ was coined by Molisch to describe any biochemical interaction between plants and
microorganisms, positive or negative. Soon afterward, studies by Benedict, Bonner and Galston, Evenari, and McCalla
and Duley again documented chemotrophic plant effects, and the term _allelopathy_ came into common usage for the first
time (Willis 1985).

Muller introduced the concept of interference in 1969 as a way of explaining both competition and allelopathy in a
single theory. Ecologists began to realize that competitive or allelopathic effects may work in tandem in any given system,
and that allelopathic interactions can be particularly important in cropping systems (Rice 1984; Gliessman 2002a). More
recently, recognition of the importance of allelopathy in agriculture has led to research on ways phytotoxins can be involved
in such practices as weed control, covercropping, pest management, and even soil biofumigation (Muramoto et al. 2014).

The difficulty of demonstrating how allelopathy actually works in the field has kept ecologists from attributing a
significant role to chemical interference in overall vegetation process. But work by Bais et al. (2003) firmly placed allelopathy back on center stage. These researchers meticulously documented the displacement of native plant species by
the Eurasian spotted knapweed ( _Centaurea maculosa_ ) in the Western United States, and the role that allelopathy plays
in the process. They identified the phytotoxin that this economically destructive plant invader produces, showed how it
is released from the roots, and characterized the mechanisms that trigger the death of susceptible native plant neighbors.
Such research clearly demonstrates how allelopathy must be reckoned with in plant species interactions, both in natural
ecosystems and agroecosystems (Ren Sen et al. 2008).



An example of an allelopathic weed is bitter grass
( _Paspalum conjugatum_ ), an aggressive weed in annual cropping systems in Tabasco, Mexico. Figure 11.4 illustrates the
inhibitory effect of bitter grass when it is present in a corn
crop. As the dominance of the grass increases, the stunting
of the corn becomes more noticeable, reaching a point where
the corn is not even able to establish.


Water extracts made from the dry grass that has not yet
been leached by rains showed the ability to affect both germination and early growth of corn seed. Local farmers recognize the negative impacts of the grass on the soil, referring
to a heating effect that can cause the stunting or yellowing of
the crop. When researchers could find no temperature differences in the field with thermometers, allelopathy became
suspect. Although the evidence is not sufficient to rule out



competitive interference from the grass, the inhibitory effect
exists even when farmers add recommended levels of chemi
cal fertilizers to the crop and when rainfall is more than
sufficient.

In a study in California, two common weeds—lamb’squarters ( _Chenopodium album_ ) and redroot pigweed
( _Amaranthus retroflexus_ )—were tested for allelopathic
potential against green beans ( _Phaseolus vulgaris_ ). Both
weed species showed allelopathic potential in laboratory bioassays; in the field it was found that bean plants grown with
pigweed were stunted but had normal numbers of nodules
of symbiotic _Rhizobium_ bacteria, and that beans grown with
lamb’s-quarters were both stunted and had greatly reduced
numbers of nodules (Espinosa 1984). These results indicate
that the chemicals released by the two different weeds were

and living parts of the grass, and additional compounds are exuded from the roots. (Data from Gliessman, S.R., Allelopathy in crop/weed

impacting the crop plants in different ways, with one affecting the growth of the beans directly and the other inhibiting
the activity of N-fixing bacteria. Since the farm field was irrigated, had recently been fertilized, and crop spacing ensured
that adequate light reached the beans, removal interference
was probably minimal.

A weed species that has been studied in great detail in
order to demonstrate its allelopathic mechanisms is quackgrass ( _Agropyron repens_ ). The following findings are
described in a review by Putnam and Weston (1986):


  - Quackgrass inhibited several crop types (e.g., clo
ver, alfalfa, and barley), and this inhibition could
not be explained by removal interference (i.e.,
competition).

 - Laboratory and greenhouse bioassays demon
strated the inhibitory potential of both quackgrass
foliage and quackgrass rhizomes, although foliage
residue was twice as toxic as rhizomatous material.

Water extracts and incorporated residues were both
phytotoxic.

  - There is some evidence that greater inhibition is

observed in the presence of soil fungi.

 - Decaying quackgrass residues were shown to

produce water-soluble inhibitors, explaining the
inhibition that has been observed when quackgrass
residues are a significant part of no-till systems.

  - Inhibition of nodulation in legumes and reduction of

root hair formation in other plants are suspected as
being possible mechanisms of inhibition.

  - Several compounds have been isolated and identified

from water extracts and decomposition products,



and include several phenolic acids, a glycoside, a
compound known as agropyrene, and a flavone tricin and related compounds.

  - Even when quackgrass is killed with herbicides, the

plant residues and toxins in the soil must be allowed
to degrade prior to successful establishment of the
succeeding crop.


The case of quackgrass demonstrates that allelopathic interference can be very important, but it also suggests that different plant parts may play different roles, and that phytotoxic
compounds can enter the environment through different
mechanisms and have varying impacts on crops.


**A** **llelopathic** **E** **ffects** **of** **C** **rops**


Although much research has focused on the allelopathic
potential of weeds in agroecosystems, many crop plants have
been shown to release phytotoxins as well. Such mechanisms
of interaction have important possibilities for farmers looking for alternative management practices.


**Covercrops**
Covercrops are usually grown during a fallow period in a
crop field in order to protect the soil from erosion, contribute
organic matter to the soil, improve soil conditions for water
penetration and retention, and “smother” weeds. Covercrops
of wheat, barley, oats, rye, grain sorghum, and Sudan grass
( _Sorghum sudanense_ ) have been used effectively to suppress
weeds, primarily annual broadleaf species. The weed suppression ability of many of these and other covercrops is due
at least in part to allelopathy (Duke 2010).


**140** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems


Because the phytotoxic compounds released by covercrops
typically break down relatively quickly in the environment,
they generally have little effect on the subsequent crop. The
compounds inhibit weeds during the time they are actively
produced by the covercrop plants, but after the plants die or
are killed through tillage, the compounds quickly degrade
(Mamolos and Kalburtji 2001).



The allelopathic potential of winter rye ( _Secale cereale_ )
has been particularly well studied (Barnes et al. 1986). Rye
produces considerable biomass early in the growing season,
and has found much success as a green manure crop in poor
soils. But it is most notable for its ability to suppress weed
growth while it is actively growing, as well as after rye residues are incorporated into the soil with tillage or left on the
soil surface after cutting. Allelopathic effects are even seen
from residues left on the soil after herbicide spraying has
killed the cover. Extensive chemical analysis has identified
two benzoxazolinones and associated breakdown products as
the probable phytotoxic agents.

The covercrop called velvet bean ( _Mucuna pruriens_ ),
used extensively in rural Tabasco, Mexico, has been shown
to inhibit weeds through allelopathy. This annual vining
legume is planted into a corn crop near the end of the cropping cycle. It covers the open space between the corn plants,
effectively suppressing weed growth, both before and after
harvest. The weed suppression is due in part to shading, but
release of allelopathic compounds is also at work. After the
velvet bean plants complete their life cycle, they are left dead
on the ground, covering the soil with a nitrogen-rich mulch
into which the next corn crop will be planted. Large areas
are managed in this manner without the use of fertilizers or
herbicides (Gliessman and Garcia-Espinosa 1982).

As more information is generated on the mechanisms
of phytotoxin release in covercrops, farmers will be better
able to optimize the use of covercrops for weed control by
maximizing the addition of the chemicals into the soil and
improving the timing of incorporation. Since covercrop species will vary from region to region, an understanding is also
needed of how local climates affect the mechanism of release

of the toxins into the environment where they can impact
weeds. Proper species selection and management will vary
accordingly.


**Organic Mulches Derived from Crops**
Plant materials and crop residues can be brought to the field
and spread over the soil, serving as organic mulch. Waste
plant material from farm fields or the processing of farm
products is particularly useful for this purpose. Such materials were already discussed for their value as soil amendments
(Chapter 8), but an important benefit of many mulches that
often gets overlooked is their potential for allelopathic weed
control.


Like the phytotoxins produced by covercrops, the biologically active compounds found in organic mulches degrade
relatively quickly, as a rule. However, breakdown rates do
differ. For this reason, the timing of mulch application, as
well as the amount and age of the mulch, must be carefully



**FIGURE 11.5** **Cacao pod hulls used as an allelopathic mulch,**
**Tabasco, Mexico.** The dark cacao hulls, seen between rows of zucchini, suppress weed growth.


considered so as to maximize weed inhibition and limit the

effect on crops.

An excellent example of an allelopathically active mulch is
dried and crushed cacao pods, obtained in the cocoa production process after the seeds and pulp have been removed from
the pods. Spread over the surface of the soil or between established crop plants, the crushed pods leach tannic substances
that can inhibit the germination and establishment of weeds.
Laboratory bioassays of water extracts of the pod material
show considerable allelopathic potential. Other types of crop
and processing residue with allelopathic potential include
coffee chaff from the dried beans, almond hulls, rice hulls,
apple pomace, and grape skins and seeds (Figure 11.5).


**Crop Inhibition of Weeds**
When a crop plant itself is able to inhibit weeds through allelopathy, farmers have a very important tool to add to their
tool box. Several crops are known to be effective in suppressing weeds that grow near them (Ren Sen et al. 2008). The
list includes beets ( _Beta vulgaris_ ), lupine ( _Lupinus_ sp.), corn,
wheat, oats, peas, rice, buckwheat ( _Fagopyrum esculentum_ ),
millet ( _Panicum_ sp.), barley, rye, and cucumber ( _Cucumis_
_sativa_ ). Allelopathy can be implicated in all cases, but
research needs to thoroughly determine the role phytotoxins
play in relation to other forms of interference. In some cases,
the inhibition appears to occur from substances released by
the living crop plants, but in others it appears that the effect is
left over from decomposition products of crop residues incorporated into the soil at the end of the crop cycle. Care has
to be taken to keep these inhibitory effects on weeds from
affecting the crops that follow. Mixtures of these crops might
express even greater allelopathic activity through complementary combining of phytotoxins.

Squash has been shown to be an especially effective allelopathic crop (Fujiyoshi et al. 2007). Rain leaches inhibitors
out of the large, horizontally arranged leaves, and once in
the soil, these compounds can suppress weeds. The shade

Bioassays show the allelopathic potential of water extracts
of intact leaves on a range of species, with weeds often being
inhibited to a greater extent than crop plants (see Table 11.4).
When squash is added to an intercropped agroecosystem
such as corn and beans, it takes on the important role of weed
suppressor for the entire mixture.

Other research has shown that older varieties of some

crops, especially the varieties most closely related to wild
stock, show the greatest allelopathic potential (Batish et al.
2001; Shen et al. 2008). Crop breeding may have selected
against allelopathic potential in exchange for higher crop
yields. Screening for allelopathic types in germplasm collections of crops could lead to incorporation of greater allelopathic potential in current crop types through conventional
crop breeding or the use of more recently developed genetic
engineering technologies.

Considering the problems associated with currently used
weed control strategies—possible environmental pollution,
groundwater contamination, increased cost of developing
and testing new herbicides, increased herbicide resistance by
weeds, and the difficulties of registering new herbicides—
allelopathic potential in crops will become a more attractive
alternative. Connecting the plant’s allelopathic potential with
an understanding of the fate and activity of the phytotoxic
compounds once they leave the plant will make these alternatives most useful.


**G** **rowth** **S** **timulation**


The emphasis in the foregoing discussion has been primarily on the inhibitory or negative impacts of chemicals added
to the environment by plants. There are, however, limited



reports of plants releasing compounds into the environment
that have stimulatory effects on other plants around them.
Such stimulatory addition interferences can be classified as
allelopathy as well, since the term was originally coined to
include them along with inhibitory effects.

In some cases, low concentrations of otherwise inhibitory
chemicals may actually have a stimulatory effect. Bioassays
for allelopathic potential often show increased root elongation in newly germinated seeds when plant extracts are at low
concentrations. In other cases, plants produce compounds
with wholly stimulatory effects. For example, an older study
(Gajic and Nikocevic 1973) found that a weed known as corn
cockle ( _Agrostemma githago_ ) had an appreciable stimulatory
effect on wheat yields when grown in mixed stands as compared to wheat grown alone. A stimulatory substance isolated
from corn cockle was named agrostemmin, and when applied
separately to wheat fields was shown to increase wheat yields
in both fertilized and unfertilized areas. Rice (1984) reports
on work where chopped alfalfa added to soil stimulated the
growth of tobacco, cucumber, and lettuce, and a substance
known as triacontanol was identified as the stimulant. Even
some substances isolated from weeds have stimulatory
effects at certain concentrations. Researchers are challenged
to demonstrate ways that some of these effects can be practically incorporated into cropping system management, but
the potential certainly exists once the full mechanisms of the
interference are worked out.


**IMPORTANCE OF INTERACTIONS**

**AMONG ORGANISMS**


Organisms can have positive and negative influence on each
other depending on the nature of their interactions. These
interactions have dynamic and potentially important impacts
on the environment of agroecosystems. This chapter proposes
a model for the study and understanding of such interactions
that focuses on the mechanisms through which one organism
adds to or removes from its immediate environment some

resource or material that can have consequences for the other
organisms living there.

As we will see in Section IV, finding effective ways of
harnessing and managing the interactions among organisms
is at the very heart of developing more sustainable practices
in agriculture. The autecological perspectives on these interactions developed in this chapter will be a necessary basis for
exploring their action and management at the level of crop
populations, crop communities, whole agroecosystems, and
the landscape in Chapters 14 through 21.
