## 3. The Plant

The design and management of sustainable agroecosystems
has important foundations in our understanding of how
individual plants grow, develop, and eventually become the
plant matter we use, consume, or feed to our animals. This
chapter reviews some of the more important plant physiological processes that allow a plant to live, convert sunlight into
chemical energy, and store that energy in parts of the plant
and in forms we can use. The chapter also reviews some
of the principal nutritional needs of plants. Finally, by way
of introduction to the rest of the chapters in Section II, the
chapter reviews some of the most important concepts and
terms used to describe the ways individual plants respond
and adapt to the range of environmental factors we will be
examining.


**PLANT NUTRITION**


Plants are autotrophic (self-nourishing) organisms by virtue
of their ability to synthesize carbohydrates using only water,
carbon dioxide, and energy from the sun. Photosynthesis, the
process by which this energy capture takes place, is thus the
foundation of plant nutrition. Yet manufacturing carbohydrates is just part of plant growth and development. An array
of essential nutrients, along with water, are needed to form
the complex carbohydrates, amino acids, and proteins that
make up plant tissue and serve important functions in plants’
life processes.


**P** **hotosynthesis**


Through the process of photosynthesis, plants convert solar
energy into chemical energy stored in the chemical bonds
of sugar molecules. Since this energy-trapping process is so
important for plant growth and survival, and is what makes
plants useful to humans as crops, it is important to understand how photosynthesis works.

The descriptions of the processes of photosynthesis that
follow are very simplified. For our purposes, it is more
important to understand the agroecological consequences
of the different types of photosynthesis than to know their
actual chemical pathways. However, if a more detailed
explanation is desired, the reader is advised to consult a plant
physiology text.

As a whole, the process of photosynthesis is the solarenergy-driven production of glucose from water and carbon
dioxide, as summarized in this simple equation:


[6CO] 2 +12H O 2 + light energy → C H O 6 12 6 + 6O 2 + 6H O 2



Photosynthesis is actually made up of two distinct processes,
each with multiple steps. These two processes, or stages, are
called the **light reactions** and the **dark reactions** (Figure 3.1).

The light reactions function to convert light energy into
chemical energy in the form of ATP and a compound called
NADPH. These reactions use water and give off oxygen. The
dark reactions (which take place independently of light) take
carbon atoms from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and use
them to form organic compounds; this process is called **car-**
**bon fixation** and is driven by the ATP and NADPH produced
by the light reactions. The direct end product of photosynthesis, often called **photosynthate**, is made up mainly of the
simple sugar glucose. Glucose serves as an energy source for
growth and metabolism in both plants and animals, because it
is readily converted back to chemical energy (ATP) and carbon dioxide by the process of respiration. Glucose is also the
building block for many other organic compounds in plants.
These compounds include cellulose, the plant’s main structural material, and starch, a storage form of glucose.

From an agroecological perspective, it is important to
understand how photosynthesis can be limited. Temperature
and water availability are two important factors. If temperatures are too high or moisture stress too great during the
day, the openings in the leaf surface through which carbon
dioxide passes begin to close. As a result of the closing of
these openings—called **stomata** —carbon dioxide becomes
limiting, slowing down the photosynthetic process. When the
internal concentration of CO 2 in the leaf goes below a critical
limiting concentration, the plant reaches the so-called **CO** **2**
**compensation point**, where photosynthesis equals respiration, yielding no net energy gain by the plant. To make matters worse, the closing of the stomatas under water or heat
stress also eliminates the leaf’s evaporative cooling process
and increases leaf O 2 concentration. These conditions stimulate the energetically wasteful process of **photorespiration**,
in which O 2 is substituted for CO 2 in the dark reactions of
photosynthesis, producing useless products that require further energy to metabolize.

Some kinds of plants have evolved different ways of fixing
carbon that reduce photorespiration. Their alternate forms of
carbon fixation constitute distinct photosynthetic pathways.
Altogether, three types of photosynthesis are known to exist.
Each has advantages under certain conditions and disadvantages in others.


**C3 Photosynthesis**
The most widespread type of photosynthesis is known as
C3 photosynthesis. The name comes from the fact that the

**FIGURE 3.1** **Basic processes of photosynthesis.** Photophosphorylation is another name for what occurs during the light reactions; the
Calvin cycle is the basis of the dark reactions.



first stable compound formed in the dark reactions is a threecarbon compound. In plants that use this pathway, carbon
dioxide is taken in during the day through open stomata and
used in the dark reactions to form glucose.

C3 photosynthesis plants do well under relatively cool
conditions, since their optimum temperature for photosynthesis is relatively low (see Table 3.1). However, because their
stomata must be open during the day to take in carbon dioxide, C3 plants are subject to photosynthetic limitation during
times of heat or drought stress: the closure of the stomata to
prevent moisture loss also limits the intake of carbon dioxide
and increases photorespiration. Common crops that use C3
photosynthesis are wheat, oats, beans, squash, and tomatoes.

**C4 Photosynthesis**
A more recently evolved form of photosynthesis is known as
the C4 type. In this system, CO 2 is incorporated into fourcarbon compounds before it enters the dark reactions. The
four-carbon compound is transported to special cells rich
in chloroplasts known as bundle sheaths, clustered around
veins in the leaves, where enzymes break loose the extra
carbon as CO 2 . The CO 2 is then used to form the threecarbon compounds used in the dark reactions, just as in C3
photosynthesis.

The C4 pathway allows carbon fixation to occur at much
lower concentrations of CO 2 than does the C3 pathway. This
enables photosynthesis to take place while the stomata are
closed, with CO 2 liberated by internal respiration being captured rather than CO 2 from outside air. The C4 pathway also
prevents photorespiration from occurring because it makes it
much more difficult for O 2 to compete with CO 2 in the dark
reactions. Thus, photosynthesis in C4 plants can occur under
conditions of moisture and temperature stress, when photosynthesis in C3 plants would be limited. At the same time,
C4 plants usually have a higher optimum temperature for
photosynthesis.

C4 plants therefore use less moisture during times of high
photosynthetic potential, and under warm and dry conditions
have higher net photosynthesis and higher biomass accumulation than C3 plants. C4 photosynthesis involves an extra
biochemical step, but under conditions of intense direct sunlight, warmer temperature, and moisture stress, it provides a
distinct advantage.

Some well-known crops that use C4 photosynthesis are
corn, sorghum, and sugarcane. A lesser-known C4 crop is
amaranth. C4 plants are more common in tropical areas,
especially the drier tropics. Plants that originated in drier
desert regions or grassland communities of warm temperate
and tropical climates are more likely to be C4 plants.


**CAM Photosynthesis**
A third type of photosynthesis is called crassulacean acid
metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis. It is similar to C4

photosynthesis. During the night, while the stomata can be
open without causing the loss of undue amounts of moisture,
carbon dioxide is taken in and the four-carbon compound
malate is formed and stored in cellular organelles called vacuoles. The stored malate then serves as a source of CO 2 during the day to supply the dark reactions. Plants using CAM
photosynthesis can keep their stomata closed during the day,
taking in all the CO 2 they need during the night. As would
be expected, CAM plants are common in hot and dry environments, such as deserts; they include many succulents and
cactus. Bromeliads that live as epiphytes (plants attached to
other plants and not rooted in soil) are also CAM plants; their
habitat in the canopy of rainforests is much drier than the
rest of the rainforest community. An important crop plant
using CAM photosynthesis is pineapple, a member of the
Bromeliaceae.


**Photosynthetic Pathways Compared**
A comparison of the different photosynthetic pathways is
presented in Table 3.1. The different arrangements of chloroplasts within the leaves of each type are correlated with
different responses to light, temperature, and water. C3
plants tend to have their peak rate of photosynthesis at moderate light intensities and temperatures, while actually being
inhibited by excess light exposure and high temperatures. C4
plants are better adapted to high light and temperature conditions, and with the ability to close stomata during daylight
hours in response to high temperature and evaporative stress,
they can use water more efficiently under these conditions.
CAM plants can withstand the most consistently hot and dry
conditions, keeping stomata closed during daylight hours, but
they sacrifice growth and photosynthetic rates in exchange
for tolerance of extreme conditions.

Despite the greater photosynthetic efficiency of C4 plants
under warmer and drier conditions (Table 3.2), C3 plants
such as rice and wheat are responsible for the great bulk of
world food production. The superiority of C4 photosynthesis
makes a difference only when the ability of the crop to convert light into biomass is the sole limiting factor, a situation
that seldom occurs in the field.


**C** **arbon** **P** **artitioning**


The carbon compounds produced by photosynthesis play
critical roles in plant growth and respiration because of
their dual role as an energy source and as carbon skeletons
for building other organic compounds. How a plant distributes the carbon compounds derived from photosynthesis
and allocates them to different physiological processes and
plant parts is described by the term **carbon partitioning** .
Since we grow crops for their ability to produce harvestable
biomass, carbon partitioning is of considerable agricultural
interest.

Although photosynthesis has an efficiency of energy
capture of about 20%, the process of converting photosynthate into biomass has an efficiency that rarely exceeds 2%.
This efficiency is low mainly because internal respiration

(oxidation of photosynthate for cell maintenance) uses up
much of the photosynthate and because photorespiration
limits photosynthetic output when photosynthetic potential
is highest. Much research aimed at improving crop yield has
focused on increasing the efficiency of photosynthetic carbon
fixation, but this goal continues to elude researchers.

Since the ability of plants to create biomass is limited,
how they partition the fixed carbon they do create is of paramount importance in agriculture. Humans select plants that
shunt more photosynthate to the part of the crop that is to be
harvested, at the expense of other plant parts. Thus, the primary basis for increasing crop yield through plant breeding,
both traditional and modern, has been the enhancement of
harvested biomass relative to total plant biomass.

The harvestable or harvested portion of most crop plants
usually has limited photosynthetic capacity itself, hence
yields depend a great deal on carbohydrate that is transported
through phloem cells from photosynthetically active parts of
the plants to the harvestable parts.

In ecological terms, we often refer to carbon partitioning as a “source, path, and sink” phenomena (Figure 3.2).
The source is usually the leaf, the chloroplasts in particular. Much detailed research has been done on the physiology
and biochemistry of the actual transfer of carbon out of the
chloroplast and into transport paths. A complex set of chemical locators and enzymes are active in this process. Once in
the phloem, carbon then moves through the stem to grain,
flowers, fruits, tubers, or other parts, which are the sinks. At
this point there is phloem “unloading” and sink uptake. The
actual transfer from vascular strands to sink tissue is often

based on a sugar concentration gradient.

**FIGURE 3.2** **Carbon partitioning.**


The products of photosynthesis are compounds of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen that make up an average of 90%
of plant dry matter. Therefore, there is a close relationship
between whole-plant photosynthesis and whole-plant productivity. Overall photosynthetic rates are related to rates per
unit leaf area, as well as to the production of new leaf area,
but they are also dependent on the rate of transfer from source
to sink. Carbon is kept in the area of leaf development while
new leaves are forming; only after all leaves are formed can
the transfer to other sinks take place. After the canopy closes,
crop photosynthesis and growth depend mainly on net CO 2
fixation per unit leaf area.

Over the growing season, the various sinks of the plant
compete with each other for the supply of fixed carbon produced by the leaves, with the result that some parts of the
plant accumulate more biomass than others. The mechanisms
regulating this partitioning of photosynthate within the plant
are not well understood, though it is clear that the process is
dynamic and related to both environmental conditions and
the genetically determined developmental patterns of the
plant. Ways of modifying carbon partitioning in crop plants
are being explored by researchers; one example involves the
development of perennial grain crops, where the challenge is
to balance the partitioning of carbon between the vegetative
body of the perennial plant (especially the roots and stems)
and the grain.


**N** **utritional** **N** **eeds**


Photosynthesis provides a plant with a large portion of its
nutritional needs—energy, and carbon and oxygen for
building important structural and functional compounds.
Together with hydrogen—derived from the water that enters
plant roots as a result of transpiration—carbon and oxygen
make up approximately 95% of the average plant’s fresh
weight.

The elements that make up the other 5% of living plant
matter must come from somewhere else—namely the soil.



These other elements are plants’ essential nutrients. They
are needed to form the structures of the plant, the nucleic
acids directing various plant processes, and the enzymes and
catalysts regulating plant metabolism. They also help maintain internal osmotic balance and have a role in the absorption of ions from the soil solution. If an essential nutrient is

not available in adequate supply, the plant suffers and does
not develop properly. In agriculture we have learned how to
adjust the supply of these nutrients in the soil to meet the
needs of our crops.

The three nutrients that are required in relatively large
amounts, and have played such important roles as inorganic
fertilizers in agriculture, are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These are classified as macronutrients. Plants vary in
the actual amounts of these nutrients they require. Since each
plant variety has become adapted to different habitats with
different environmental conditions, it makes sense for there
to be such variation in nutrient requirements. A review of
some of this nutritional variation can tell us a lot about proper
crop selection and fertility management.


**Nitrogen**
Nitrogen is needed in large amounts by plants, but at the
same time is the most universally deficient nutrient. It occurs
in every amino acid, and as a result is a major component of
proteins. Nitrogen is therefore involved in some way with up
to 50% of dry plant biomass. It is required in enzyme synthesis, with a deficiency affecting almost every enzymatic reaction. Since nitrogen forms part of chlorophyll and is required
in its synthesis, it is no wonder that nitrogen-deficient plants
show the yellowing that is indicative of limiting amounts of
this nutrient in the soil. Adequate supplies of nitrogen are
also needed for normal flowering and fruit set in all plant
species. Plants commonly have 1%–2% nitrogen as a proportion of dry weight, but contents above 5% are not unusual.

Except for nitrogen that is captured directly from the air
by symbiotic microorganisms that live in the roots of most
members of the Fabaceae and a few other plant families and
passed on to the host plants in an available form, most plants
obtain their nitrogen from ion exchange with the soil solution
as NO 3− or from NH 4+ adsorbed to humus or clay minerals.

Available forms of nitrogen in the soil are generally kept at
low levels by rapid uptake of nitrogen when it is available
coupled with nitrogen’s high potential for leaching loss with
rainfall or irrigation percolation.


**Phosphorus**
Phosphorus is an important component of nucleic acids,
nucleoproteins, phytin, phospholipids, ATP, and several other
types of phosphorylated compounds including some sugars.
Phosphorus is built into the DNA of chromosomes and the
RNA of the nucleus and ribosomes. Cell membranes depend
on phospholipids for the regulation of movement of materials
in and out of the cells and organelles. Phosphorus in the form
of phosphates occurs in certain enzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions. Sugar metabolism in plants, for example,
depends on phosphoglucomutase. Phosphorus also occurs in


The Plant **39**



primary cell walls in the form of enzymes that affect cell
wall permeability. The initial reactions of photosynthesis
also involve phosphorus; it is found in the five-carbon sugar
with which CO 2 initially reacts.

Phosphorus is absorbed as phosphates from the soil solution through plant roots. Phosphates in solution are readily
available and taken up by plants, but except in soils that are
derived from parent materials high in phosphorus or where
phosphorus levels have built up over time in response to
many years of fertilization, available phosphorus in most
soils is quite low. Plants will opportunistically take up large
amounts of this nutrient when it is available, accumulating
about 0.25% of dry weight, but are quick to show signs of
deficiency when it is lacking. Leaves take on a bluish cast
or remain dark green, and purple pigments (anthocyanins)
become prominent on the underside of the leaves and along
the veins or near the leaf tip. Root and fruit development are
severely restricted when phosphorus is limiting.


**Potassium**

Potassium is not a structural component of the plant, nor a
component in enzymes or proteins. Its main role is to provide
the appropriate ionic environment for metabolic processes
that take place in the liquid contents of the plant cell, or the
cytosol. In relation to this role, it has regulatory functions: it
is involved, for example, in osmoregulation (stomatal movement) and as a cofactor for many enzyme systems. Most
metabolic processes that have been studied are affected by
potassium. In protein metabolism, for example, it appears
that potassium activates certain enzymes that are responsible
for peptide bond synthesis and the incorporation of amino
acids into protein. Potassium needs to be present for the formation of starches and sugars, as well as for their later transport throughout the plant. This nutrient has been shown to
be needed for cell division and growth, and is linked to cell
permeability, proper turgidity, and hydration. Plants show
better resistance to disease and environmental stress when

potassium supplies are adequate.

Plants obtain potassium in the form of the cation K [+], taking it in through the roots as exchangeable ions from adsorption sites in the soil matrix or from a dissolved form in the
soil solution. When potassium is deficient, plants primarily
show disruptions in water balance; these include drying tips
or curled leaf edges, and sometimes a higher predominance
of root rot. Potassium is usually quite abundant in soils, with
plant tissues being made up of 1%–2% potassium by dry
weight under optimum conditions, but excessive removal
through harvest or soil leaching can lead to potassium
deficiency.


**Other Macronutrients**

Three other nutrients—calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and
sulfur (S)—are also considered to be macronutrients, but this
classification is more a function of the relatively high levels
in which they accumulate in plant tissue and less because of
their importance in different plant structures or processes.
This is not to say that they do not play valuable roles, because



when any of these nutrients are deficient in the soil, plant
development suffers and symptoms of deficiency show up
quickly. Calcium and magnesium are readily absorbed by
plant roots through cation exchange (as Ca [2+] and Mg [2+] ), but
sulfur is taken up sparingly as an anion (SO 42− ) from organi
cally bound sites in the soil or upon dissociation of sulfates
of Ca, Mg, or Na.


**Micronutrients**

Iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), boron (B), and chlorine (Cl) make up what are
called the micronutrients or the trace elements. Each one

plays some vital role in plants, but usually in extremely small
quantities. In fact, most of these elements are toxic to plants
when they occur in the soil in large quantities. All are taken
up from the soil solution through ion exchange at the root
surface.


The role that each of the micronutrients plays in plants’
life processes is outlined in Table 3.3. As one would imagine, any of the important physiological processes listed could
be inhibited or altered by a deficiency of the micronutrient
concerned. Many inorganic fertilizers carry small quantities
of these elements as contaminants, and mixtures of trace elements are now commonly added to soils that have undergone
a long period of conventional management. Organic fertilizers, especially those made from composted plant material
and manure, are rich in micronutrients.

continual flow of water from the soil to the atmosphere along
a pathway that extends from the soil, into the roots, up the
stem to the leaves, and out of the leaves through the stomata.
This flow process is called **transpiration** .

Water loss from the leaves creates a concentration gradient, or a lower leaf water potential, that then through capillarity moves more water into the plant and to the leaves to
replace the loss. The actual amount of water that is chemically bound in plant tissues or that is actively involved in
processes such as photosynthesis is very small in proportion
to the transpirational loss of water on a daily basis. Water
movement through plants is very important in nutrient cycles
and under conditions of limited water availability in the soil,
as we will see in later chapters.


**THE PLANT IN ITS INTERACTION**

**WITH THE ENVIRONMENT**


Each of the physiological processes described earlier allows
the plant to respond to and survive in the environment in
which it lives. An understanding of the ways individual
plants and their physiology are impacted by different factors
of the environment is an essential component in the design
and management of sustainable cropping systems.

The ecological study of individual plant response to the
diverse factors of the environment—termed autecology or
physiological ecology in the pure sense and crop ecology
in the applied sense—is therefore a foundation of agroecological understanding. Some of the conceptual basis of autecology is reviewed in the next section. Each factor of the
environment and its effects on crop plants is then explored in
a separate chapter in preparation for expanding our view to
the agroecosystem level.


**A P** **lant** **’** **s** **P** **lace** **in** **the** **E** **nvironment**


Each species occupies a particular place in the ecosystem,
known as the **habitat**, that is characterized by a particular
set of environmental conditions that includes the interaction

of the species with the other species in the habitat. Within its
habitat, the species carries out a particular ecological role or
function, known as the **ecological niche** of that species. For
example, coast redwoods ( _Sequoia sempervirens_ ) occupy a
specific habitat on the north coast of California characterized by a moderating maritime climate and the occurrence
of summer fog that compensates for a lack of rainfall during
this time. At the same time, redwoods occupy the ecological niche of autotrophic producers capable of modifying the
microclimate under their emergent canopies and being the
dominant species in their community.


**R** **esponses** **to** **F** **actors** **of** **the** **E** **nvironment**


Every plant during its lifespan goes through distinct stages of
development, including germination of the seed, initial establishment, growth, flowering, and dispersal of seed. Each of
these stages involves some kind of physiological change, or



**response**, in the plant. Most plant responses are tied directly
to environmental conditions.


**Triggered Responses**
Many plant responses are triggered by some external stimulus. They come about as a result of a certain condition, but
that external condition does not have to be maintained in

order for the response to continue. For example, tobacco
seed requires exposure to light in order to germinate, but that
exposure need only last for a fraction of a second. After a
brief exposure to light, the seed will germinate even if it is
planted in total darkness.


**Dependent Responses**
Some plant responses depend on the continued presence of a
particular external condition. The response is both induced
and maintained by the condition. The production of leaves
on the spiny stems of ocotillo ( _Fouquieria splendens_ ) in
the Sonoran Desert is an example of this type of response.
Within a day or two after significant rainfall, leaves appear
on the stems; as long as moisture levels are sufficient in the
soil, the leaves are retained, but immediately upon reaching
the wilting point the leaves are dropped.


**Independent Responses**
Finally, certain responses in plants occur regardless of conditions in the immediate environment and are the result of some

internally controlled, physiologically determined set of factors.
For example, a corn plant begins to flower because a particular
stage in growth and development has been achieved. External
conditions may force later or earlier flowering by affecting
growth, but the actual shift to flowering is internally controlled.


**L** **imits** **and** **T** **olerances**


The ability of an individual species to occupy its particular
habitat is the result of a set of adaptations that have evolved
over time for that species. These adaptations allow the plant
to cope with certain levels of moisture availability, temperature, light, wind, and other conditions. For each of the factors
that delimit the habitat for the species, there is a maximum
level of tolerance and a minimum level of tolerance beyond
which that species cannot cope. Between these two extremes
there is an optimum at which the species performs or functions the best. For example, the tropical plant banana has a
mean monthly temperature optimum of 27°C; above 50°C
banana trees suffer sunscorch and stop growing; below
21°C growth is checked by reduction in leaf production and
delayed shooting of the bunches.

A particular species’ range of tolerance limits and optimum for a factor of the environment is ultimately the result of
how that factor affects each of the physiological processes of
the plant (Figure 3.3). A species’ tolerance of a range of temperatures, for example, is linked to how temperature affects
photosynthesis, transpiration, and other physiological processes of the plant. When all of the abiotic and biotic factors
of the environment are entered into the tolerance equation,

the full range of a species’ adaptability becomes apparent. An
individual’s habitat and niche become fully integrated.

A species with a broad set of tolerances of environmental conditions (known as a **generalist** ) and a broad ability to
interact with other species (often referred to as a species with
a broad niche or the capability of considerable niche overlap)
will be more common over a larger area. In contrast, a species with a narrow set of tolerances and a very specialized
niche (a **specialist** ), will be less common over larger areas
and only seen as common at a very localized level. Redwood
sorrel ( _Oxalis oregana_ ), an ecological specialist, can form
dense stands in which it is the locally dominant plant, but it
is restricted to the specific conditions encountered in the partially shaded understory of a redwood forest. If the shade is
too dense, photosynthetic activity is not great enough to meet
the plant’s respiratory needs, and if the sun is too intense,
sorrel is unable to tolerate the desiccating effects of direct
solar radiation. Redwood sorrel’s optimum level of light is
intermediate to these two extremes.


In summary, each individual plant species occurs in a
particular habitat as a result of the development over time of
a particular set of adaptive responses to the environment in
which it lives. The species’ limits of tolerance restrict individuals of that species to a particular habitat, within which
interactions with other species occur. This is the case in both
agroecosystems and natural ecosystems. How each plant in
an agroecosystem performs will depend on how each factor
of the environment impacts it. We will explore these factors
in detail in the following chapters.


**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**


1. How might the different forms of photosynthesis that

occur in plants have come about? What specific conditions of the environment would select for each type
and how might we use this knowledge in agriculture?
2. What would you consider to be “balanced plant

nutrition” and how would you try to maintain it in
an agroecosystem setting?



3. Why does a plant partition carbon to different parts

of the plant structure?
4. How many factors need to be included to be able

to thoroughly understand the full range of conditions that determine an individual plant’s habitat?
5. How is plant nutrition affected by the shift from

easily soluble synthetic fertilizers to more complex
organic soil amendments, as commonly applied in
organic farming systems?
