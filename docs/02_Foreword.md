## Foreword

Do not mistake this for just a textbook. You hold in your
hands the key to making a difference. If life is about understanding the times in which you live and therefore what you
should do with your life, then this trove of accumulated scientific insight and social wisdom from Stephen Gliessman
is sure to be a key stepping stone. The reason is that Steve
methodically lays out the cumulus of four decades of his
experience and reflections, connecting science to purpose,
action, and meaning.

With few exceptions, treatments of agriculture are
about methods (how you do something) and not about the
substantive questions of all human activity: what and why
we do something. Tractors, fertilizers, and modified seeds
are examples of some of the ways we perform agriculture.
Hunger, power, and inequity are examples of attributes of
agriculture and food systems and therefore why it is important to fully understand context before launching unquestioningly into methods and practices.

We are all part of a human culture (including our food
system) that has settled on a predominant view of life as
domination over nature and other people. Examples of the
negative impacts of this domination are most obvious in the
unjust conditions faced by too many people in the food system workforce, from the fields, to processing and packing
plants, to shipping and stocking shelves at markets, to the
food service sector. Instead of living wages, safe and healthy
working conditions, and fair immigration laws that create
opportunity while getting work done, we have an industrial,
capital-intensive system that too often exploits both people
as well as the land. We need a food system that fosters the
important indicators of sustainability such as equity, fairness,
and satisfaction for all, rather than domination that benefits
a few. Agricultural curricula must focus beyond the narrowness of specialization, reductionism, and methodologies that
primarily emphasize high yields and maximizing profits for
those in power.

Are there alternatives to the current industrial food and

agriculture system? That is what this book is about. If you are
interested in agricultural and food systems that are managed
for the long term, are more inclusive, pursue wiser purposes,
and thereby converge on different methods, this book will
prove an invaluable guide. It leads you through a succinct
case for an alternative _understanding_ of agricultural and
food systems as opposed to formulaic methodologies. A farm
field is not an outdoor factory, with inputs and outputs that
are allegedly understood and calculated precisely on one
end and maximized on the other end, scored by how much
money can be squeezed from the proposition. Instead, you’ll
understand a farm as a cross section of many processes to be
understood and integrated, where there are multiple goals,



and where perpetual resilience is the key attribute because
that is the way that all components do best over the long term.
This includes ourselves, since, after all, humans cannot exist
without supportive ecosystems.

And I should stress that this synthesis involves rigorous
science, which you will enjoy immensely. One of the delights
of agroecology is that it provides an answer to the very logical question for all thoughtful explorers of human knowledge: “Why should I learn this?” Here, you’ll find the payoff
for the basic studies you’ve undertaken. Physics, biochemistry, and mathematics are joined seamlessly with economics,
sociology, and political science to render clearer the things
that we all care about. As one example, consider a fundamental question to put to all human endeavors: “How long can
we keep doing things this way?” This is the _sustainability_
_question_, and it can be confronted competently only by combining insights from many fields of human knowledge and
experience. You’ll see this throughout this book, but particularly around such topics as whether we have an impending
phosphorus shortage (a nonrecyclable and limited nutrient),
the notion of multifunctionality and integrated landscapes,
and the contextualization of the food justice movement.
Gliessman is one of the world’s masters of this integrated
approach, and one of the best embodiments of the expertise
that Robert Rodale called _metasystematics_, the discernment
of how systems in perpetual motion relate with and affect
one another.


This is a skill that may be unique now, but one that
humanity will require in greater measure in our crowded
future. As an advocate for more resilient food systems based
on the principles of agroecology, I earnestly recommend that
you invest yourself in developing depth and proficiency in
this essential science. As with Gliessman, your credibility
and effectiveness will be the more potent for your indisputable command of what Bertrand Russell called a knowledge
more important than the understanding of facts, that being
the connections among facts. By the time you work through
this deft exposition, you will understand why agriculture
must be fundamentally transformed, how ecological science
can be applied to that end, and how social movements are
as essential to that transformation as is the understanding of
trophic interactions.

Finally, this book is a declaration of purpose: the intent
to apply knowledge to improve and sustain the dignity
of life for all, human and otherwise. As a book, this is an
ambitious inquiry and a survey for the brave and forwardlooking, from a brave and forward-looking scholar. But as
an intellectual and moral challenge, this is nothing short
of a call for epochal culture shift. It is time to move our
knowledge about sustainable food systems beyond the safe spaces of seminar rooms and scholarly publications.

We need an _open-access_ system that turns knowledge into
practice, rather than into proprietary technologies owned
by a few and for sale to the rest. We must understand the
dynamics of economic and political power and its ability to
limit, shape, and control the food system. Turning knowledge into social action on behalf of greater human wellbeing is the ultimate responsibility of the learned, which
is to share the insights that the generosity of others has
allowed one to derive, in a perpetual chain of meaning and
moral action. Einstein stated, “Humanity has every reason
to place the proclaimers of high moral standards and values
above the discoverers of objective truth.” Steve Gliessman
is both a discoverer and practitioner of objective truth and a

proclaimer of high moral standards. Tellingly, it is not only
his many accomplished former students who can attest to
this, but scores of farmers whose livelihoods have markedly
improved because Gliessman is about science, purpose, and
moral action. Here, he has painstakingly, joyously, fully,
and generously laid out his understanding from a lifetime
of effort on these fronts.
