## 10. Fire

Fire is a major form of environmental change or disturbance. In natural ecosystems, it removes dominant plant species, displaces animals, returns nutrients to the soil, and burns accumulated litter on the forest floor. Nearly all the vegetation of the earth has been influenced in some way by fire. Periodic fires of varying frequencies and intensities are thought to occur in most ecosystems, especially in regions with pronounced dry seasons.

The most common fires are natural in origin, but anthropogenic (human-induced) fires have a considerable history as well. There are reports in the literature of charcoal deposits in tropical rain forest areas dating back as far as 6000 BP, many of which appear to be associated with human activity. Before the development of early agricultural tools, fire may have been the most important “tool” early humans had for vegetation management.

Some natural vegetation types that have evolved in areas where fire is relatively frequent are actually dependent on fire for their long-term stability; these include certain prairie, savanna, shrub, and forest types. The shrubby vegetation of ecosystems with a Mediterranean climate (called _chap-_ _arral_, _matorral_, or _caatinga_ ) is probably the best-known fire-dependent vegetation, often being described as a “fire climax” community (Figure 10.1).

In early ecological research, fire was not studied much, because it was seen only as a destructive force, and because it was hard to observe its actual effects. More recently, however, detailed studies of fire in ecosystems such as California chaparral have helped make fire an important topic of ecological investigation. Today, fire is seen as an integral part of many ecosystems, as witnessed by the rising use of controlled or prescribed burns in the management of parks and nature reserves. Fire plays very important roles in agroecosystems as well: it is an important part of the practice of shifting cultivation, and is used to manage crop residue, kill weeds, and clear slash following logging.

**FIRE IN NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS**

A fire can occur in an ecosystem when three conditions are met: an accumulation of sufficient fuel or organic matter, dry weather, and a source of ignition. For millions of years, lightning was the primary source of ignition. It is still important today, causing the fires responsible for more than 50% of the acreage consumed by wildfires in the Western United States (Pyne 2012). In very recent geologic time, humans have become another important “source of ignition.” Humans have used fire since the Paleolithic, as long as 500,000 years ago. Fire was

probably used first for the hunting or herding of animals, and then evolved into a vegetation management tool. Burning may have been used to provide better feed for animals, or even to promote the presence of certain plants that served as food or materials sources. Eventually, fire became a tool to prepare the ground for planting, with evidence thus far showing that early slash-and-burn agriculture began about 10,000 years ago.

From an ecological perspective there are primarily three types of fires:

- **Surface fire.** This is the most common type of fire.

Fire temperatures are not too hot, with flames burning the trash, grass, or litter that has accumulated on the surface of the soil. Such a fire can move along under a forest canopy and not burn the trees. Changes that occur in soil conditions during a surface fire are usually short lived, although the understory vegetation can be greatly altered. Surface fires can be used to either control or promote the growth of weedy or invasive vegetation, depending on the circumstances.

- **Crown fire.** This type of fire can be very damag ing for some types of vegetation, whereas it may be an integral part of rejuvenating other types. During crown fires, the canopy of the vegetation is consumed, and usually the mature plant species are killed. Crown fires are usually very fast moving and often combine with a surface fire to burn everything above the soil surface.

- **Ground or subsoil fire.** This type of fire is not

very frequent, but when it does occur, it can be very destructive. It is characteristic of soils that are high in organic matter, especially peat or muck soils. Organic matter in the soil can be burned down to the mineral soil layer. These are usually slow fires, with more smoke than flame, that dry the soil as they burn. Roots and seeds in the soil are killed, and animal habitats are severely altered.

Any individual fire can combine aspects of all three fire types. In general, the intensity of a fire is very closely related to the frequency of fires in the area (Figure 10.2).

**EFFECTS OF FIRE ON SOIL**

Much of the ecological significance of fire revolves around its effects on the soil. Fire has very noticeable impacts on a range of abiotic and biotic components of the soil ecosystem,

**117**

**118** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

and knowledge of these impacts is important in employing fire as a tool for agroecosystem management. It must be pointed out, however, that the effects of fire will vary widely depending on the type and stage of development of the vegetation, the type of soil, the season of burning, the prevailing weather conditions, the amount of time since the last fire, and other conditions.

**A** **biotic** **F** **actors**

**FIGURE 10.1** **Chaparral fire in the Santa Ynez mountains** **near Santa Barbara, CA.** Periodic fires are part of the evolutionary history of chaparral; humans have only recently disrupted the natural pattern of burning.

When a fire occurs, the temperature of the surface layers of the soil is raised. The actual heating rate and depth depends on the amount of moisture in the soil and the type of fire. Temperatures during a burn at the surface of the soil almost always exceed 100°C and can reach as high as 720°C for brief periods of time. Increases in temperature below the surface are usually restricted to the upper 3–4 cm of soil, where they rise 50°C–80°C above the temperature present before the fire, usually for only a few minutes (Raison 1979). These temperatures are high enough to modify the soil environment in ways that can be useful for agroecosys tem management.

**FIGURE 10.2** **The three types of fires.** A slow-moving, cool surface fire (a) burns litter in the understory of summer deciduous forest in northwestern Costa Rica.

A subsurface fire (c), visible in the distance, burns in a swamp near Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico.

Fire **119**

The complete burning of aboveground organic matter combusts most nitrogen and organic acid components, returning inorganic cations to the soil (mainly K [+] and Ca [2+] ) which then have an alkalizing effect. The strength of this effect depends on the intensity of the fire and the thoroughness of the combustion of plant biomass, but increases in soil pH during the first several days following fire, especially once the soil is moistened by precipitation, are commonly 3 or more pH units.

Following the fire, the blackened soil surface will tend to have more solar gain; however, if the standing biomass was considerable before the fire and burn temperatures were very high, enough white ash may be present at the surface to actually have the opposite effect for a short period of time. The higher albedo of the white surface will reflect solar energy and limit soil heating.

The hot temperatures caused by fire can greatly reduce the amount of organic matter in the upper layers of the soil. At a temperature of 200°C–300°C for 20–30 min there is an 85% reduction in organic matter, with an accompanying release of CO 2, a loss of nitrogen and sulfur in volatilized forms, and the deposition of minerals.

After fire there is usually a reduction in soil moistureholding capacity, although with the removal of vegetative cover, actual moisture availability in the soil can increase because of reduced demand. Soil aggregate size is reduced, bulk density goes up, and permeability and water infiltration rates are reduced. Often there is also an increase in rainfall

runoff and nutrient leaching, and the possibility of greater soil erosion until the soil is covered once again with vegetation. It is not uncommon just after a fire for the immediate surface of the soil to actually be water repellent, but this condition is usually overcome after some exposure to moisture.

Generally speaking, most of the abiotic effects listed above are of a rather short-term nature. Regeneration of the vegetation, coupled with replacement of soil organic matter, leaching rainfall, and plant modification of the burned conditions, rapidly begins the process of recovery. In the case of severe fire intensity following excessive fire suppression and abnormal fuel buildup, or in the case of a fire burning thick organic layers of peat or muck that reaccumulate at a very slow rate, abiotic conditions can be altered for longer periods of time. Unnaturally frequent fires, usually human induced, can also lead to more lasting change.

**B** **iotic** **F** **actors**

Obviously, any living plants or animals caught in the path of a fire are in peril. Plants that are not adapted to fire are easily killed, especially if the bark type does not protect the living cambium. If the fire is hot enough and other conditions are right, living plant matter can be killed, dried out, and ignited very rapidly, reducing all aboveground material to ash. Then, if the plants do not sprout from belowground structures, recovery will only begin with the germination of seeds. Seeds of some species of plants are

**FIGURE 10.3** **Fire response by pines.** Young lodgepole pines reestablish following devastating crown fires that killed the parent trees in Yellowstone, Wyoming.

killed by fire, whereas others are either stimulated by the breaking of specific dormancy factors or by the creation of soil conditions that favor germination and establishment (Figure 10.3).

Repeated fire can retard the vegetation recovery process to the point that another vegetation type, more tolerate of fire, can establish dominance. The conversion of shrubland to grassland is a good example of this process. On the other hand, some vegetation types are in a sense kept healthy by periodic fire, because the fire removes old and dying individuals, returns stored nutrients to the soil, and stimulates renovation by new or younger individuals.

Many larger animals can avoid fire by moving away from it, but even when they are killed by fire, their populations in the burned area can recover through recolonization from nearby unburned areas. Some animals actually seek out recently burned areas because of the concentration of new growth and forage for feed, or because the ash can aid in the removal of parasites such as ticks and fleas.

Following a fire there is an immediate reduction in the populations of nearly all soil-dwelling organisms, including fungus, nitrifying bacteria, spiders, millipedes, and earthworms. Many die as a result of the high temperatures, but some organisms are impacted by the changes in pH that follow the fire or by the flush of certain nutrients into the soil that comes from burned organic matter. After a fire, however, there is fairly rapid recolonization, especially by bacteria that are stimulated by the increase in pH.

On the whole, fire can have both negative and positive impacts on the environment, but regardless it must be remembered that the intensity, duration, and frequency of fires in natural ecosystems are incredibly variable. From 1 year to the next, conditions that favor fire are going to vary tremendously. And when a fire does occur, its effects will not be uniform. Some areas will be burned very thoroughly, whereas a short distance away the same type of ecosystem may be spared the impacts of fire completely.

**PLANT ADAPTATIONS TO FIRE**

In any location where fire has a long evolutionary history, most plants and at least a few of the animals have developed adaptations to fire. It is interesting that the adaptations that provide resistance to fire in plants are in many cases also traits that enable the plants to deal with excess light or drought stress.

Plants can be adapted to fire in three different ways.

1. **Fire resistance.** Plants with fire resistance have

traits that help prevent the living parts from being burned in a fire. These traits include such characteristics as thick bark, fire-resistant foliage, or a litter mat that will support frequent but less damaging fires. 2. **Fire tolerance.** Fire-tolerant plants have traits that

allow the plant to survive being burned in a fire. A common fire-tolerant trait is the ability to resprout from the crown following a fire. 3. **Fire dependence.** Fire-dependent plants actually

require fire for reproduction or long-term survival. Some fire-dependent plants have seeds that need fire before they will germinate, or cones that will not open unless exposed to fire. Other fire-dependent plants will not flower until after a fire, or will become senescent unless exposed to periodic fires.

**FIRE IN AGROECOSYSTEMS**

Fire has a long history of use in agriculture. But from an agroecological perspective, there can be good fires and bad fires, overuse or underuse of fire, and careful or careless use of fire. The challenge is the appropriate application of the knowledge of the ecological impacts of fire.

**S** **hifting** **C** **ultivation**

The agroecosystem with the longest history of fire use is shifting cultivation, or slash-and-burn agriculture. Shifting cultivation with the use of fire continues today to be the most important form of subsistence agriculture in many parts of the world. Although thought to be practiced primarily in the tropics, fire-based shifting cultivation was used in early agriculture even in Europe, where wheat and barley were grown on a 10–25-year fallow cycle (Russell 1968). Although it might seem quite simple to clear, burn, and plant, good shifting cultivators have learned through experience that the timing of all activities, especially the fire, makes the difference between a sustainable system and a degrading system (Figure 10.4). Shifting cultivation works when the system is allowed enough time for natural successional processes to restore the soil fertility lost through disturbance and crop harvest (Figure 10.5).

Immediately following a fire, nutrient mobility in the system is quite high, often resulting in high leaching losses. This accentuates the need for a fallow period in order to recover the lost fertility. Crops in slash-and-burn systems need to

**FIGURE 10.4** **Managing fire in a slash-and-burn agroecosys-** **tem in Tabasco, Mexico.** A small firebreak separates the fire from future slash and nearby crops.

**FIGURE 10.5** **Pattern of shifting cultivation in the mountains** **of Chiapas, Mexico.** Fallow plots of various ages are clearly seen next to plots being farmed. Farmers say that a 15–20-year fallow period is required for the system to be sustainable over the long term. Pressures to shorten this fallow period are many.

quickly pick up the nutrients added to the soil from ash, or else leaching will remove them or invading noncrop plant species will begin to capture them. Depending on soil types, climatic regimes, and cropping practices, the rate of nutrient loss varies considerably. But studies have shown that the loss can be rapid and high, especially for nutrients such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium (Nye and Greenland 1960; Ewel et al. 1981; Jordan 1985). Repeated fires in short succession, as well as soil cultivation, can accelerate nutrient loss even more (Sanchez 1976) (Figure 10.4).

Shifting cultivation systems are generally thought to be able to sustain relatively low human population levels. In well-managed shifting cultivation systems, most of the soil carbon and nitrogen remains following a fire, the root mat stays intact and alive, the soil surface is protected by some form of biomass cover, and even soil mycorrhizae survive.

Fire **121**

As a result, nutrient loss and soil erosion are minimized, and the system is sustainable. But many of these systems have recently begun to move in an unsustainable direction, because an array of social, economic, and cultural factors create pressures that shorten the fallow period, remove fallen timber for firewood, introduce inappropriate crops, or overgraze animals, eventually promoting the invasion of noxious weedy species or leading to a breakdown of the processes that enhance the recovery of native species ground cover. Overuse of fire is often one cause of the breakdown in sustainability.

In modern agricultural systems, fire plays many diverse roles. The examples presented in the following represent different levels of technology and have different levels of use depending on the agroecosystem type, part of the world, and cultures involved. They can be used at any time during the cropping cycle, from preplant to harvest, depending on the system and the purpose. The biggest challenge in the use of fire overall is to understand how to take advantage of the beneficial effects of fire while avoiding or minimizing the negative ones. Skill, experience, and knowledge are all required.

**Land Clearing** In many parts of the world today, fire continues to be the most accessible and affordable tool for clearing vegetation and plant biomass from the soil surface prior to preparing the land for planting, especially in present-day versions of shifting cultivation. The use of fire for land clearing is particularly important in many forestry systems, where the large slash load left after logging is burned to make replanting easier, as well as to reduce the chance of a wildfire moving through the dry slash and suppressing the establishment of seeded or transplanted tree seedlings.

The amount of dry matter that needs to be cleared will obviously have a great impact on the type and intensity of the fire. As shown in Table 10.1, these amounts, called slash loads, vary considerably depending on the system. Slash left on the soil in tropical shifting cultivation systems can easily exceed 4 kg/m [2], and if adequately dried and burned at an appropriate time, will carry a hot, uniform fire that will consume most all of the plant material except large-diameter branches and trunks (Ewel et al. 1981). Even young second growth produces 1–2 kg/m [2] of dry matter and can easily carry a fire (Gliessman 1982).

Logging of older forest systems invariably leaves the forest littered with logs, tops, and branches, which can become a fire hazard as they dry out. Such slash can also harbor pests and be detrimental to the recovery of tree seedlings. On the other hand, as the debris decomposes it improves soil structure and nutrient status while protecting the soil against erosion. All of these factors need to be taken into account in

deciding if slash should be burned uniformly over the surface, piled so that impacts of burning can be localized, or left

unburned as a mulch. In some traditional systems, when slash is limited in supply (usually less than 0.5 kg/m [2] ), it is piled, burned, and the ash is scattered uniformly over the cleared fields as a fertilizer (Figure 10.6).

A unique example of the use of fire for land clearing is a system for renovating old cacao plantations in Tabasco, Mexico that are no longer profitable. First, bananas are planted in the understory. The next year, all overstory shade trees and old cacao trees are cut, leaving a heavy slash load of more than 5 kg/m [2] that covers the corms of the bananas.

**FIGURE 10.6** **Burned slash piles in Chiapas, Mexico.** When biomass production is limited by climate or short fallow, slash can be piled for burning and the ash spread.

Once adequately dried, the slash is burned. Immediately after the fire, a traditional corn/bean/squash intercrop is planted in the same way as in local shifting cultivation systems, allowing for a harvest within 6 months after cutting of the trees. While the annual crops are being planted and cared for, sprouting bananas and new shoots from the trunks of the leguminous shade trees are protected and allowed to develop. After the annual crop has completed its cycle, short-lived perennial crops such as yuca (cassava) or papaya are planted. By the time these crops are harvested, the bananas have formed a fairly continuous canopy, producing bananas (or plantain) for local use or sale. By the third year, the resprouted shade trees have also begun to become part of the shade-producing canopy. At this point, shade conditions at the soil surface have returned to the

reduced levels appropriate for the replanting of new cacao seedlings. Bananas are harvested up to the time the new cacao plants come into production (5–7 years after planting), at which point the renovation cycle is complete. Local farmers claim that without the use of fire, it would be at least 10 years before cacao could begin to be replanted on such a site—a long time to wait for this valuable cash crop. Research is needed to tell us exactly how fire benefits this agroecosystem (Figure 10.7).

**Nutrient Additions to the Soil**

In many cropping systems in the world, the ash left after burning crop residues, noncrop slash, and even wood for cooking or heating is seen as a valuable nutrient source that should be returned to the soil. Ash is quickly carried into the soil with rainfall and the nutrients it contains are readily available as part of the soil solution. The loss of nitrogen and sulfur to volatilization during burning is more than offset by a gain in all other nutrients and by an increase in their availability to plants. Ash has been shown to contain as much as 2.6% potassium, and appreciable amounts of phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and other mineral elements. Since ash can amount to between 0.4 and 0.67 kg/m [2], it has significant

potential as a nutrient input to agroecosystems (Seubert et al. 1977; Ewel et al. 1981; Debano et al. 1998).

Of course, being so soluble, these nutrients can easily be washed out of the system, so effective plant cover and good root development should accompany the addition of nutrients from ash. Timing of ash application is very important. There must be active plant roots in the soil to rapidly take up the highly soluble nutrients. And knowledge of rainfall patterns is needed to avoid having heavy rains follow burning or ash application, so that nutrients are not leached below the root zone or washed off the surface. Research is needed

that determines which crop systems or combinations can best take advantage of fire-released plant nutrients.

**Crop Residue Management** Fire is often used as a tool for crop residue management. One of its main benefits is to make nitrogen from the residue more easily available to the following crop. When the residue is very high in carbon as compared to nitrogen (C/N 25–100), the nitrogen in the residue can be immobilized by incorporation into microbial biomass (and then more permanently into soil humus). Burning, however, makes the nitrogen readily available for uptake by plants. Even though most nitrogen is lost through volatilization during burning, the C-to-N ratio of the ash is lower relative to that of unburned residue, making the nitrogen that remains more readily available and reducing the need for external nitrogen amendments.

Another benefit of residue burning is reduction in the amount of tillage needed. Also, in many parts of the developing world, residue is burned not to eliminate the residue, but as fuel for home heating or cooking. Sometimes the ash is collected and returned to fields as a soil amendment.

Rice production is often associated with fire. In any part of the world where rice is grown, the straw and stubble left following harvest can amount to as much as 0.95–1.0 kg/m [2] . Traditionally, this straw has been used as animal feed, fuel, or construction material, or as raw material for compost.

(a) (b)

**FIGURE 10.7** **Using fire to renovate old cacao plantations in Tabasco, Mexico.** An annual crop of corn, beans, and squash (a) grows through the ash left from burning old cacao plants (standing) and associated shade trees. A leguminous shade tree (b; _Pithecellobium saman_ ) begins to recover following the fire. It will be pruned to one or two stems and eventually provide shade for new cacao plants.

Fire **123**

In many present-day rice systems, however, the increasing need to get another crop into the ground as soon as possible following the rice harvest has led to the use of fire to quickly reduce the straw to ash. Burning does reduce stubble-borne diseases and insects, and also reduces the potential of methane being produced during decay under flooded conditions in amounts that might become toxic to some following crops. But due to the perceived impact of the smoke on atmospheric quality, regulations increasingly limit burning and force farmers to deal with the reincorporation of the straw into the soil, or to find alternative uses for harvested straw (Kanokkanjana and Garivait 2013).

From the standpoint of sustainability, the many advantages of residue burning must be weighed against disadvantages that include loss of nutrients through volatilization or leaching, air pollution, exposure of soil surface, and loss of organic matter inputs to the soil. Because the drawbacks of using fire are not insignificant given the ways in which the agricultural context is changing, it is becoming increasingly important to research alternatives to traditional uses of fire for crop residue management; an example is using greenmanure covercrops that substitute for the traditional fallow and fire for corn production in southern Mexico (CastilloCaamal et al. 2010).

**Weed Management** Fire is used for weed management most effectively and practically when the weeds are either in the litter or soil as seed, or shortly after the seeds have germinated. Seeds or seedlings in the litter are most likely to be killed by fire, since litter at the surface burns at high temperatures and down to the soil surface. For this reason, it is necessary to have some kind of mulch cover or crop residue to carry the fire. Slashand-burn systems are very effective at destroying seed in the litter and on the immediate soil surface.

A more recently developed practice for weed control has been used in Europe for many years. A propane tank is connected to a hose and a nozzle so that a flame can be moved rapidly over the soil surface to destroy weed seedlings. Both backpack- and tractor-mounted flame weeders are available. Specially shaped nozzles and an assortment of deflectors and shields protect any crop seedlings while desiccating the weeds. Weed seedlings must be very small to be effectively controlled with this technology, or the seedlings of the crop must be at a stage of development that gives them greater resistance than the weeds to the heat. Under some field conditions, a crop such as corn in its first and second leaf stage has a structure and moisture content that will keep it from suffering damage while most surrounding weed seedlings are killed. The necessary equipment can be expensive to purchase and use, and depends greatly on the use of fossil fuel, but in some very weed-prone crops like carrots and onions, flame weeders are a very cost-effective means of weed control.

But fire must be used on weeds with care. Perennial weeds and those with fire-resistant roots, rhizomes, crowns, or other structures that resist burning may actually

be stimulated by fire. Bracken ( _Pteridium aquilinum_ ), for example, is a very aggressive plant that can act as a weed in deforested or pasture areas, and is favored by fire in two ways (Gliessman 1978d). Its deep underground rhizomes permit it to survive fire, and there is some evidence that removal of aboveground litter of bracken actually promotes more vigorous regrowth of the fern. At the same time, spores of the fern are favored by the soil conditions created by fire and ash, allowing for initial establishment of the fern where it didn’t occur before and the potential for its aggressive vegetative growth from then on. In shifting cultivation systems, where fire is used to help clear the fallow, fire can begin to have negative effects if the fallow period is too short. These effects can include leaching of nutrients and invasion of fire-resistant weeds. In general, the use of fire for weed control requires careful consideration of its potential impacts, based on the unique characteristics of the

system.

**Management of Arthropods** Fire is a very effective means of eliminating damaging arthropods, such as insects and mites, from an agroecosystem. Heat, smoke, and loss of habitat all combine to either kill these organisms (as well as their eggs or larva) or drive them from the system. In some natural ecosystems, fire is probably as much a factor in the natural fluctuations of arthropod populations as climatic factors or trophic interactions. Fire suppression in forests may actually be upsetting the natural equilibrium, allowing outbreaks of such common pests as bark beetles, leaf miners, and lepidopterous leaf eaters such as tent caterpillars. In some ecosystems, however, fire may not impact arthropod populations. Joern (2005), for example, found that different burn frequencies had no effect on grasshopper species diversity or density in North American tall grass prairies. In other studies, it has been found that even though fire impacts arthropods, the effects are short term—generally the arthropod community largely recovers in just a few years (Pryke and Samways 2012). Since the ecological characteristics of each arthropod taxa are so different, much needs to be known about each species’ life history and adaptations to fire in order to understand how fire may impact it.

In agroecosystems, especially with the growing popularity of reduced- and no-till agriculture, fire has once again begun to play a role in pest management. Many insect pests can pass the time between cropping seasons in some part of the plant left over from the previous season, either living or dead, and burning these insect refuges can be an effective way of controlling the pests. Bollworm problems in cotton, for example, are dramatically reduced if all plant residue is destroyed, and fire is one tool for achieving this end. Because stemborers in grain crops overwinter in straw remaining in the field after harvest, appropriate use of fire might aid in their management.

Fire has proven to be effective in control of the hessian fly in wheat production in the wheat belt of the United States. The fly became a significant problem in the 1990s

**FIGURE 10.8** **Using burned beetles to repel other beetles in Tabasco, Mexico.** (a) The beetle pest _botijón_ feeds on a bean plant. (b) The beetles are put in jars and heated just enough to kill them. (c) The open jars are then placed in the soil around the bean planting.

after reduced-tillage management was mandated for wheat in the mid-1980s. The overwintering pupae of the fly survived in the straw residue on the soil surface. Controlling the fly with pesticides proved very difficult and expensive, but burning the stubble in the fall was found to be very effective (Whitworth 2011).

For ground-dwelling arthropod pests, fire that penetrates the soil surface can be a useful method of pest management. Burning mulch or crop residues, and artificial flaming of the soil surface, are ways of introducing fire for this

purpose.

A traditional practice that used fire to protect a crop from insect damage is known from Tabasco, Mexico. A large coleopteran beetle has a reputation for being able to invade a bean planting and defoliate the crop in a very short period of time. The beetles invade in large numbers and can be seen consuming the plant leaves in the early morning hours. Farmers report that an old practice was to come into the infested field in the morning, collect enough of the live beetles to place 25–50 of them in each of several fireresistant containers. At the end of the day, each container was placed over a fire long enough to kill the insects but not to burn them. Shortly thereafter, the open containers were partly buried in the soil in the bean field, about 1 to every 400 m [2] . By the next morning, farmers report, there were no

signs of living or actively feeding beetles in the field. An alarm pheromone released by the dying beetles is suspected of alerting living beetles to danger so they leave the field, but further research is needed. Farmers have stopped using this practice since synthetic chemical pesticides have been introduced (Figure 10.8).

**Pathogen Management** Because of fire’s ability to elevate temperatures in the soil, especially close to the surface, fire should be expected to have a significant impact on plant pathogens living in the soil, such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes. It is important to note, however, that the majority of soil biota is not pathogenic, and in fact plays beneficial roles in agroecosystems (see Chapter 8). Therefore, fire should only be used to manage specific disease problems or outbreaks.

Heat and desiccation probably have the greatest direct impact on pathogenic organisms. The high temperatures registered at the soil surface during a fire, and the penetration of heat down to several centimeters below the surface, can kill large numbers of living pathogens and their inoculum. In addition, the sudden increase in pH caused by the wetting of ash deposited on the soil after a fire can have an inhibitory affect on fungi since fungi prefer neutral to acid conditions for optimal development. Many bacteria, on the

Fire **125**

other hand, are actually stimulated by the higher pH, so any pathogenic bacteria present could become more of a problem after a fire.

The effect of burning aboveground plant material, especially crop residues, on potential plant pathogens is well documented. Since a well-managed fire can consume as much as 95% of the aboveground biomass and generate extreme heat, it can kill most pathogens present in the biomass. This effect of fire is the most common reason for burning crop residues, as described earlier.

The bulk of the literature about the effect of fire in relation to plant disease management is from several decades ago when the use of fire faced fewer prohibitions and people were less concerned about air pollution. In a review published in 1976, for example, Hardison found that fire could effectively reduce inoculum of diseases of various forest crops, fruits, ornamentals, cotton, potatoes, small grains, and grasses, and forages (Hardison 1976). It is interesting to note that the burning of grass fields, a practice that has become very important in fields used to produce commercial grass seed in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, was started originally for the purpose of disease control in the late 1940s.

With the growing popularity of reduced-tillage systems, especially for grain crops, fire once again is being considered as a disease control strategy. In the development of perennial grain crops (see Chapter 14), where intensive cultivation is not possible due to the long-lived nature of perennial grains, fire must be contemplated as a disease management tool (Cox et al. 2004). Such fires occurred naturally in the perennial prairie ecosystems once present in most grain-growing regions, and as perennial grain systems are developed, it will be important for us to understand these natural fire regimes and the roles they played in the prairie

ecosystem.

**Preparing a Crop for Harvest** Fire can be used to prepare a crop for harvest. A common example is the burning of sugarcane fields a few days ahead of harvest of the canes. Cane cutters claim that fire is important for removing the leaves from the stems, facilitating the cutting process when done by hand, making access to the canes easier, and displacing bothersome animals such as rats and snakes. But ease of harvest in such a system has to be weighed against ecological impacts such as loss of organic matter, volatilization of certain nutrients, and nutrient leaching with heavy rainfall. For sugarcane in particular, another possible negative impact of fire may be to degrade the quality of the sugar extracted from overheated canes.

Another simple role for fire at harvest time is in the collection of pine nuts. Cones of several pinyon pine species are collected from trees before they open and disperse their seeds (called nuts). Usually the cones are coated by dense pitch. Fire is used to heat rocks that are then placed with the cones, melting away the pitch and opening the cones to

release the seed. Fire can also be used to heat an oven into

which the pitch-covered cones can be placed.

**Pasture and Range Management** Despite the fact that in most grassland areas of the world, natural fire is frequent and an important aspect of the environment, the effective use of fire as a tool for managing grazing systems is not really that common. When fire is used in grazing systems, it is employed in the form of a controlled fire known as a **prescribed burn** . A prescribed burn in a grazing agroecosystem can play many roles. It can

- Burn off unpalatable growth from previous seasons

that is not eaten by most animals and that would otherwise compete with more desirable species;

- Stimulate growth (in the form of fire-response

sprouting of perennial plants) during times of the year when very little green growth would normally be available;

- Destroy parasites such as ticks and fleas that can

carry stock disease;

- Control the spread of undesirable plants in pasture

or range;

- Remove the fire hazard of accumulated old browse

or grass;

- Establish fire breaks as a system of protection from

wildfire;

- Prepare a seedbed for natural or artificial seeding of

desired plant species;

- Stimulate some plants to produce seed;

- Encourage growth of native legumes for forage and

soil improvement;

- Promote more rapid nutrient cycling and uptake.

All of these potential effects of fire can play important roles in determining the most appropriate regime of management using fire.

The relative importance of each of the impacts of burning varies with the type and intensity of grazing system, time since the last fire, season of the year, and the stage of development of the edible plants. In open grassland, for example, there is little tendency for woody species to invade; therefore fire is employed to remove the accumulation of inedible growth. In savanna regions, or areas where natural succession would favor shrub or tree vegetation, burning is of much greater importance for suppressing some plants while establishing or maintaining the pasture components.

When fire is withheld from a grazing area that normally burns with some regularity, grasses lose their dominance and can be replaced by nonedible or poorly consumed shrubs or tree species. For example, the rangeland in the Great Basin of the Western United States converts to sagebrush ( _Artemisia_ _tridentata_ ) with lack of fire, especially when combined with excessive grazing pressure. The open savanna areas of the parts of the southwest United States or northern Mexico, where grasses grow between mesquite and juniper, become

virtual forests of the tree species when fire is not incorporated into the management of the rangelands. In other areas, where grassland borders shrub or tree vegetation, lack of periodic fires can allow the gradual invasion of the grassland by the more aggressive woody species. Annual grasslands in the foothills of the coastal mountains of central and south ern California are encroached upon by allelopathic chaparral shrubs when fire is withheld for more than a few years (Muller 1974) (Figure 10.9).

**FUTURE RESEARCH**

Probably one of the oldest tools used in agriculture, fire is still of considerable value in the present-day search for sustainable farming practices. But being able to use fire to benefit the system depends on having knowledge of the long-term impacts that fire will have on different components of agroecosystem structure and function. Research is needed that goes beyond thinking of fire as a destructive factor in the environment and helps us make use of its ability to release nutrients from organic matter, quickly alter agroecosystem structure, kill undesirable organisms, and emulate the disturbance regimes of natural systems.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. What kind of knowledge and information is needed

to convince farmers to use fire as a tool for contributing to sustainability? 2. Smoke in the atmosphere is often considered wholly

undesirable, with new restrictions being placed on smoke-generating activities every day. How would we justify the use of fire in agriculture even though smoke may be one of the by-products?
