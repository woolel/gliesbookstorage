## 13. Heterotrophic Organisms

So far we’ve discussed agroecosystems as if they are based entirely on the growth of plants. Although plants are indeed the foundation for growing our food, we can’t ignore the fact that animals—and other non-photosynthesizing organisms, like insects and fungi and some protists—are both absolutely essential elements of agroecosystems and factors that must be taken into account in managing these systems. In Chapter 2 we defined these organisms as _heterotrophs_, or all organisms that meet their nutritive and energetic needs by consuming other organisms.

Various types of heterotrophs were discussed as biotic factors of the environment in Chapter 11. In this context, we looked at the _interactions_ between heterotrophs and other organisms, and our interest was in categorizing these interactions and distinguishing them by type, rather than in examining the heterotrophs themselves. In this chapter, we shift our frame of reference to the heterotrophic organisms, looking at these organisms directly rather than as special kinds of biotic factors. This results in two related but distinct discussions.

In _Heterotrophs as Factors Affecting Crop Plants_, we focus on heterotrophs as factors of the environment but give attention to the organisms involved and the particular effects they have on crop plants. In _Animals as Resources in Agricultural_ _Production_, we discuss animals as organisms from which humans derive food and which, like crop plants, confront an environment made up of separate factors.

**HETEROTROPHS AS FACTORS**

**AFFECTING CROP PLANTS**

As described in Chapter 2, heterotrophic organisms play important roles in ecosystem structure and function. In their roles as consumers, either as primary consumers of plants or secondary consumers of other animals or animal products, they are essential elements in energy flow, nutrient cycling, and the regulation of the numbers of other organisms, especially plants. As primary consumers they are herbivores, parasites, or pollinators of plants. As secondary consumers they are parasites or predators of other animals. Because they fill all these many and varied roles in ecosystems and agroecosystems, heterotrophs have a variety of opportunities for presenting themselves as factors of the environment in relation to individual crop plants.

**H** **erbivory** **by** **I** **nsects** **and** **O** **ther** **I** **nvertebrates**

As discussed in Chapter 11, herbivory is a removal interference that represents a very direct impact on a plant,

with plant tissue being removed by the consuming organism. The niche of herbivore has been exploited by nearly every group of terrestrial animals over evolutionary time, but in terms of numbers of species, insects have gone the furthest in taking advantage of plants as a ready food source. Of the more than one million insect species known, about 26% are phytophagous (plant eating). With their capacity for converting plant biomass to animal energy, the impact of these insects on food webs and food chains is quite dramatic (Price 1997; Vandermeer 2011). Several other invertebrate groups, such as mollusks (snails and slugs), are also herbivores, but since insects are the most important group in most agroecosystems, we will focus on them here.

Herbivorous insects have many specialized ways of finding, choosing, ingesting, and consuming plant matter. They have chemical, visual, and other ways of distinguishing between toxic and non-toxic plants, as well as between more or less nutritious material. Many insects have specialized mouth parts or digestive systems adapted for dealing with specific plant parts, species, or vegetation types. Some herbivorous insects are very specialized in what they consume, whereas others are considered generalists and consume a broad spectrum of plant matter. It is a pretty good bet that if there is plant matter present, some insect herbivore will be able to eat it!

Plants have the disadvantage in that they are unable to avoid being eaten by moving. To make up for being sedentary, plants have evolved a remarkable array of anti-herbivory strategies, from toxic compounds to protective structures such as spines and thorns. Many plants produce compounds that are distasteful or repellent, such as the terpenes of many of the mint family or the cyanogenic compounds of many of the Brassicaceae.

Crop plants, especially when they are planted in monocultures, face a formidable challenge from insects since eating plant biomass is what insects have evolved to do. Whatever the method that an insect herbivore uses to find its plant-based meal, the chemical and visual cues sent out by a large monoculture are very detectable or visible. Once the herbivore finds the crop, the _r_ -selected colonization traits that will be described in Chapter 14 kick into play, and the insect quickly becomes a damaging crop pest. Because the defense compounds that plants have co-evolved as protection from herbivory have often been bred out of crop plants as a part of the domestication process, it is no surprise that insect herbivory is one of the greatest challenges facing agriculture.

From an agroecological perspective, we can divide herbivorous vertebrates into two groups: wild animals and domestic animals. Both groups have in common the fact that plant matter is the foundation of their diets, although specific plant species or parts consumed, digestion systems used, and dietary preferences vary immensely. The difference between an algal-feeding fish and a seed-eating bird is a good example. Wild vertebrates will be discussed first.

In an agroecosystem setting, wild vertebrates that enter into farming areas and consume crops are mostly considered to be pests. These include many species of birds, a number of rodents, and several larger types of mammals. Birds tend to eat mostly seeds or fruits, which in natural ecosystems is often beneficial to plants because it disperses the seeds or prepares them for germination. But when this feeding behavior is focused on a crop, damage can be quite extensive. The efforts of viticulturalists in California to protect ripe grapes from bird foraging can be seen in everything from automatic sound makers and reflectors to netting. Flocks of parakeets ( _Aratinga_ spp.) can quickly decimate rice crops in southern Mexico by consuming large amounts of grain just before harvest. Browsing black-tailed deer ( _Odocoileus hemio-_ _nus_ ) can cause significant damage to a range of crops, from tomatoes to grapes to Christmas trees. In any situation where natural ecosystems and agroecosystems form an integrated landscape, herbivory from wild animals is always a concern. Appropriate strategies for separating the crops from the animals must be taken (Figure 13.2).

Herbivorous animals that become food for humans, or supply us with other products, are a different story. These animals as elements of agricultural production will be covered in more detail in the second part of this chapter. Here we will focus on the actual impacts of their herbivory on plants.

**FIGURE 13.2** **An example of mixed pest heterotroph manage-** **ment in a Vineyard in Cuyama Valley, CA.** Birds are kept away by the hanging predator eye balloons, the reflecting mylar tape seen on the plant in the foreground, and random bird distress calls from a solar powered system housed in the box center right. Rodent control is aided greatly by the barn owls nesting in the box seen behind the call system box, and rabbit damage on young vines is avoided by plastic grow tubes. The entire vineyard is fenced to keep out deer, rabbits, and the occasional cow or horse that belongs to the neighbors.

Before domestication, grazing and browsing animals obtained their plant food from natural ecosystems. As domestication took place, animals came to depend on humans to provide for their food needs. This led to the development of various pasture-based systems that will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 19. People learned how to either manage animals for improved pasture performance or to plant grasses or legumes that provided the foundation for proper animal nutrition.

Pasture and range managers believe that grazing by livestock is good for plants. It removes accumulated biomass and stimulates new growth. Plant matter moves through the animal and is deposited on the soil as nutrient-rich manure. Interestingly, animals will selectively graze a pasture, removing the higher quality forage first and then come back to secondary forages later. Such selective grazing has impact on the species composition of pasture. Farmers have developed management plans that favor certain species of plants over others, depending on grazing pressure, animal nutritional needs, and local environmental conditions. Basically, however, herbivory determines the species composition and management strategies for range or pasture systems.

**P** **arasitism** **and** **M** **utualism** **by** **F** **ungi**

Heterotrophic fungi are important components of any ecosystem, and in agroecosystems they can play very important roles. Rather than eat or ingest their food, fungi instead absorb nutrients from the environment around them. Many fungi do this by secreting powerful hydrolytic enzymes into

Heterotrophic Organisms **151**

their surroundings that break down complex molecules into smaller organic compounds that the fungi can absorb and use. Other fungi produce enzymes that allow for the penetration of plant cell walls, enabling the fungi to absorb nutrients from the cells. Since the different enzymes produced by the various fungal species are so diverse, fungi as a group can digest compounds from a wide range of organic materials, living and dead. Further, fungi are very good at gaining access to these materials because of their incredibly extensive root-like hyphae, which form an interwoven mass called a mycelium. Combined, enzymes and hyphae make fungi remarkably efficient at water and nutrient absorption. Although the role of fungi in digesting and absorbing nutrients from dead or decaying plant matter is of considerable ecological importance, our focus for the purpose of this chapter is on their role as heterotrophic consumers and their effects on plants. Fungi affect plants in two primary ways: as parasites and as mutualistic partners.

Fungi that are parasitic on plants absorb nutrients from the cells of living plants. About 30% of the more than 100,000 known fungal species make their living as parasites, most of which are disease-causing (or pathogenic) to plants (Figure 13.3). Between 10% and 50% of the world’s fruit harvest is lost annually to fungal diseases, and grain crops can suffer major damage each year. Once infected, plants do not develop correctly, forming deformed or stunted parts. In addition, the compounds produced by the fungi—such as the aflotoxins produced by the ascomycete _Aspergillus_ when it parasitizes peanuts or grain—can be toxic to humans.

Fungi that form mutualisms with plants, on the other hand, create benefits for both organisms. This symbiotic relationship was presented as an important biotic interaction affecting plants in Chapter 12; the importance of these mutualisms in the design and management of crop communities will be described in detail in Chapter 16.

**FIGURE 13.3** **Rice blast fungus (** _**Magnaporthe**_ _**oryzae**_ **) heav-** **ily affecting rice in Tabasco, Mexico.** The fungus penetrates the leaves, causing small lesions that can quickly coalesce and kill the leaf and severely reduce grain yields. The affected areas appear darker in this photo (in life, they are reddish).

As described earlier, the hyphae of some fungi form a dense mycelial mat around the outside of the root (ectophytic mycorrhizae) and form a close relationship with the plant by penetrating the intercellular spaces of the plant roots where water and nutrient exchange can occur. Other fungi actually penetrate the cells of the plant tissue, then send their hyphae (endophytic mycorrhizae) through the intercellular spaces into the soil around the root. In both cases, the very extensive and fine network of hyphae, knitted together to form mycelia, provides benefit for the plant by expanding its capacity to absorb water and nutrients. In addition, the enzymes produced by the fungi can be antagonistic to other heterotrophic organisms in the soil ecosystem, such as pathogenic bacteria, nematodes, and other fungi, providing the plant partner protection from these pathogens. In exchange for this service, the fungus receives sugars produced by the photosynthetic activity of the plant, and both organisms prosper (Figure 13.4).

Most plants also have mutualistic fungi that live on the leaf surfaces of plants or just inside the leaf tissue without causing harm. Some of those that live inside the leaf, such as those of some grasses, make the plant matter toxic to herbivores and, in some cases, can increase the plant’s tolerance to drought, heat, or even heavy metals. The case of cacao ( _Theobroma cacao_ ) is a good example; seedlings inoculated with endophytic fungi show much lower disease levels than non-inoculated seedlings (Arnold et al. 2010).

**FIGURE 13.4** **Experimental inoculation with spores of mycor-** **rhizal fungi to enhance root colonization for strawberries.** After a soil has been managed with industrial inputs and practices for a long time, beneficial organisms may have to be intentionally introduced as part of the restoration of ecological processes.

**152** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

**P** **ollination**

As described in Chapter 11, heterotrophs play an important role in angiosperm pollination. This relationship often takes the form of a protocooperation, where multiple animal pollinators can visit many different species of plants, and a single plant species has no specific dependence on one pollinator. On the other hand, some pollination interactions have co-evolved to the point that a single pollinator species and a single plant become co-dependent, or form what is called an obligate mutualism. The plant has become completely dependent on the pollinator and vice versa (Figure 13.5). Some tropical orchids have evolved the ability to synthesize a compound that mimics exactly the sex pheromone of the female of a species of bee, enabling the plant to attract the male to the flower even though the pheromone is produced in micro quantities. Orchid flower morphology has also often co-evolved to take on the shape of a female bee’s reproductive structures and to position the pollen sac in such a way that when the male bee enters the flower, thinking it is his female counterpart, the pollen sac is attached to the bee and carried to another flower where another structure is ready to receive and remove it from the male. This “lock and key” arrangement reflects the degree to which herbivores’ need for plant food can influence plant morphology and evolution.

Approximately 80% of angiosperm species are pollinated by animals, and of these, most are pollinated by insects. Bees, in turn, are the most important insect pollinators, especially for many agricultural crops (Figure 13.6). There is great concern in North America and Europe about the current decline in honeybee populations, which is attributed to the phenomenon known as the “colony collapse disorder.” In California, more than 1.6 million domesticated bee colonies are needed to effectively pollinate the massive almond crop during a narrow few-week window of flowering in the spring. Due to a dieback of 40%–50% of commercial colonies in

**FIGURE 13.5** **A bee caught in the flower of the stream orchid** **(** _**Epipactis**_ _**gigantea**_ **) in Wyman Canyon, CA.** The orchid mimics the female bee with both its floral arrangement and the release of attractive pheromones.

**FIGURE 13.6** **Wild stingless-bee hives in the Yucatan, Mexico.** Local people have a long tradition of raising these bees in sections of hollow tree trunks. These bees are also very important pollinators of local crops such as squash and chiles.

the few months just before flowering in the spring of 2013, almond growers had to mount an immense effort to bring in bee colonies from all over the country in order to complete pollination. If the dieback continues, there will not be enough colonies to pollinate what has become the major export crop for California (Grossman 2013). Since wild bees do not occur in large enough numbers to pollinate such a large area in such a short time, domesticated colonies are the key to success. Other crops that co-evolved with honeybees in the Old World—such as cucumbers, melons, mustards, apples, and onions—are in a similar situation.

Butterflies, moths, and flies, among other insects, are also important flower pollinators, but their significance in this regard is overshadowed by their more prominent role—in their larval forms—as herbivorous pests. Some birds and bats are pollinators as well, but again their role in agriculture is rather limited. Hummingbirds are known to pollinate blueberries. Bats pollinate a range of plants, especially those that are night blooming—such as the epiphytic cactus that produces the newly popular “dragon fruit.” Bats are also important pollinators of bananas, mangoes, dates, figs, peaches, cashews, guava, avocados, and agaves (upon which we depend for tequila and mezcal).

Agroecosystems (particularly those under ecological management) also contain a relatively diverse assemblage of heterotrophs that don’t impact crop plants directly, but which play an important role regulating the population levels of potential crop pests. These include both insects that parasitize herbivorous insects (such as _Trichogramma_ wasps) and animals in a wide range of taxonomic groups that are predators on crop pests. Included in the latter category are predaceous insects, birds, bats, certain terrestrial mammals,

Heterotrophic Organisms **153**

and even reptiles and amphibians. Their role in natural or biological control is well known, and alternative farming systems like organic agriculture depend highly on the presence and effective activity of these organisms. The importance of these beneficial organisms will be discussed as elements of agroecosystems in Chapter 17.

As discussed in some detail in Chapter 8, the below-ground environment of an agroecosystem is teeming with a diverse assortment of organisms, many of which are heterotrophic. Many of these organisms, such as protists, predatory nematodes, many invertebrates, and even some fungi play important roles in the control of plant-consuming soil organisms (such as herbivorous nematodes) or as antagonists against disease-causing bacteria and fungi. Their presence is important in establishing and maintaining a balanced “pathosystem” in the soil (Garcia-Espinosa 2010). The mycorrhizal fungi discussed earlier, which form mutualistic relationships with plant roots, can provide a living barrier to disease organisms in addition to improving the uptake efficiency of water and nutrients by the roots. Earthworms consume pathogenic fungal spores and bacteria as they graze through the soil, in addition to improving soil structure and adding organic matter in the form of their excrement. By playing their many and diverse roles in the soil, heterotrophic organisms help constitute the below-ground ecosystem that is such a fundamental aspect of the soil, which, when considered as a whole, is a primary factor of the environment in which crop plants grow.

**ANIMALS AS RESOURCES IN**

**AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION**

Animals are obviously not restricted to the roles of herbivorous pests, parasites, pollinators, and predators in crop production systems. A large variety of domesticated (and semi-domesticated) animals also produce products that are of importance to their human managers (Figure 13.7). Similar to a crop plant, each type of heterotrophic animal that is an important source of products for human use and consumption has its particular set of adaptations and characteristics that determine where it grows best and under what conditions it is most successful in agricultural production.

Domesticated animals raised for food or fiber are dependent on plants for their nutrition, either directly or indirectly. This nutritional need can be met in a variety of ways, ranging from feeding them crop plants to allowing them to graze on lightly managed, unplanted pasture. Because of this dependence on plants, animals cannot be “grown” directly in the way that plants can. Plants are always part of the process, even if the plant food is grown off-farm, consists of unplanted, untilled pasture or natural vegetation, or passes first through an herbivorous intermediate (as is the case, e.g., when chickens eat insects that have fed on crop plants).

**FIGURE 13.7** **A small-scale goat production system, Mani,** **Yucatan, Mexico.** Mostly local and renewable resources are used to produce a valuable source of protein.

With this broader perspective, agroecologists must focus their attention on helping farmers ensure that not only does the dependence of animals on plants for their nutrition take place in a balanced manner, but that all other environmental factors that impact animal life and production are within the limits of tolerance that were reviewed for plants in the previous chapters. Temperature, light, water, soil, and other factors must match the needs of the animals as well as those of

the plants that feed them.

**P** **hysiology** **and** **G** **rowth** **of** **A** **nimals**

Heterotrophic organisms are different from plants in many ways. Rather than capturing energy through photosynthesis, absorbing mineral nutrients from the soil, and taking in carbon from the air, heterotrophs must ingest their food and obtain their energy from already-existing organic matter, all of which has ultimately been produced by plants or other animals. Apart from obtaining food and energy from other organisms, animals are also much more self-regulating than plants. They are relatively homeostatic in that they are able to regulate their internal conditions, such as temperature or pH. When we think of larger animals, we think of the structures they possess that maintain this homeostasis, such as lungs, a circulatory system, a digestive system, a central nervous system, and outer coverings such as hair or feathers. And of course a key element of what makes many (but not all) heterotrophic organisms successful is that they are mobile. Whereas an established plant is restricted to the location where its roots are anchored, most animals can move to seek food and shelter and optimal conditions for growth and development, and they can avoid or flee detrimental conditions or danger.

The basic introduction to the processes of food consumption, growth, and development that follows is intended to provide a background for understanding how better to integrate animals into sustainable food systems. For more depth and

**154** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

detail, we encourage the reader to consult a basic biology or animal physiology text.

**Production of Animal Biomass**

Just as plants partition carbon from photosynthesis into different plant parts, heterotrophic animals distribute, accumulate, and store carbon from the plant food they consume in tissue, organs, bones, fat, and other parts such as hair or feathers. And like plants, animals also need other elements to produce the tissues that make up their bodies, as well as the substances (such as hormones and enzymes) that allow their bodies to function. These other elements include nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and a few others needed in relatively small amounts. Animals must obtain all of these elements from the

food they ingest.

Before production of animal biomass can occur, the food that is consumed must pass through several stages of processing in order to break it down into its simpler molecular components. These components, which include fatty acids, amino acids, and simple sugars, can then be reassembled to produce the more complex molecules, and ultimately the tissues, that make up the animal’s body. The energy for this reassembly process—and the animal’s other physiological activities—comes from the further breakdown and oxidation

of some of the organic matter the animal consumes.

The processing of food begins with ingestion, or the act of eating or feeding. This occurs in a variety of ways, directly related to the ecological niche the animal has evolved to fill. Some heterotrophs are substrate feeders, living in or on their food source. Other heterotrophs are fluid feeders, sucking nutrient-rich fluids from a living host. Ticks on cattle are a good example of a fluid-feeding animal that preys on other animals, and aphids are a good example of a fluid feeder that feeds on plants. Most animals, though, are bulk feeders. They eat relatively large pieces of food by biting or tearing, and then moving the pieces into a digestive system with specialized compartments for processing. Most of the animals involved in livestock production systems have this kind of feeding system, and are primarily plant feeders.

Once food has been ingested, it is passed through an extracellular digestion system (a system that is continuous with the environment outside the animal’s body) that performs the functions of breaking down food into smaller parts, absorbing the food, and eliminating any undigested or unused matter. Each of these functions occurs in a specific compartment designed for the purpose. In vertebrates these different compartments are specialized segments of a tube that extends from the mouth to the anus known as the

alimentary canal.

Ingested organic matter must be broken down into molecules small enough for the body to absorb. This occurs through both mechanical and chemical digestion. Chemical digestion must happen because animals cannot directly use the protein, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, fats, or phospholipids that come in their food. As noted earlier, breaking larger molecules down through enzymatic hydrolysis produces the smaller component parts needed to assemble the larger

molecules that the animal needs, as well as the simple sugars that provide energy for metabolic activity.

Some mechanical digestion usually takes place in the mouth during the process of chewing, and this is accompanied by some chemical digestion as well. Saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme amylase, which hydrolyzes starch into smaller polysaccharides. Mechanical digestion is important for breaking the food into smaller pieces so that later chemical digestion will have more surface area to act upon.

Further mechanical digestion, as well as the bulk of chemical digestion, takes place in the stomach. The muscular walls of the stomach churn the food inside, and it releases both strong acids and enzymes to break apart the ingested organic matter into its constituents. The stomach empties partially digested food into the small intestine, where further digestion occurs and the next stage in the process—­ absorption of the smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars—begins.

Many animals used in agricultural production have specialized stomachs or additional organs that aid in mechanical and chemical digestion, breaking down hard-to-digest food before it enters the small intestine. Birds such as chickens, ducks, and turkeys pass food from the mouth to a crop where food can be stored while eating, and then into a stomach with two parts: a “true” stomach responsible primarily for chemical digestion and a gizzard that accomplishes both chemical and mechanical digestion. Animals known as ruminants (e.g., cattle, goats, and sheep) have stomachs with four chambers where mutualistic microorganisms enzymatically digest plant matter. A cow can regurgitate and re-chew some of the ingested grass it eats, breaking down the plant fibers further and making them more available for microbial action. A ruminant gets many of its nutrients by digesting the mutualistic organisms themselves that are mixed with the regurgitated grass but which reproduce rapidly enough to replace any that are lost.

Whatever the configuration of an animal’s stomach, the food it processes passes next into the small intestine. In mammals, the first short segment of the small intestine is called the duodenum. It is here that the mixture from the stomach

is mixed with digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Most enzymatic hydrolysis occurs in the small intestine, along with a major portion of the absorption of nutrients. Nutrients are absorbed through the feathery linings of the interior intestinal wall and enter the microscopic blood vessels, or capillaries, that are at the core of the lining, for transport to the rest of the metabolic system. The capillaries and vessels that carry nutrient-rich blood away from the lining all converge into a blood vessel that leads to the liver, then to the heart, and finally to the other tissues and organs. The liver provides two main functions: first, it regulates the distribution of nutrients to the rest of the body. The nutrient balance in the blood leaving the liver can be very different from that which entered. And second, the liver removes toxic substances before the blood circulates more widely.

The alimentary canal ends in the large intestine, which includes the colon, cecum, and rectum. The small intestine

Heterotrophic Organisms **155**

connects to the large intestine at a fork that goes one way to the colon—and then to the rectum and the anus for elimination of the final wastes of the digestive system—and the other way to the cecum. In animals that eat large amounts of plant matter, the cecum is important for fermenting ingested material so that it can be fully digested. The size of the cecum varies from animal to animal; in humans it is a vestigial organ called the appendix. The major function of the colon is to recover water that entered the alimentary canal and served as the solvent for the digestive juices. On the average, almost 90% of the fluid secreted into the digestive system is reabsorbed in the small intestine and colon.

In most herbivorous mammals, both the small intestine and the cecum are much more developed than they are in humans, and are usually occupied by mutualistic microorganisms that produce enzymes that help digest plant material, especially cellulose, into simple sugars and other compounds the animal can use. Horses, for example, have an extended cecum with such bacteria. In rabbits and some rodents, mutualistic bacteria live in both the cecum and the large intestine, but since most nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine, these animals will re-ingest feces the first time it is eliminated so that re-digestion can absorb the available nutrients that were created through bacterial activity after the food passed through the small intestine.

**Nutritional Needs of Animals**

As discussed earlier, animals must extract both nutrients and energy from the food they consume. An adequate diet must therefore contain three essential substances: (1) matter with large amounts of energy stored in its chemical bonds that can be harnessed to power cellular processes, (2) matter that contains the basic organic building blocks for macromolecules and tissues, and (3) substances that the animal cannot synthesize from smaller parts (Figure 13.8).

**FIGURE 13.8** **Cattle grazing on a diverse assortment of** **native and non-native plants growing in unplanted pasture,** **Huimanguillo, Tabasco, Mexico.** As herbivorous ruminants, cattle are well adapted to grazing on such vegetation, which provides them with all the nutrients they require.

All of an animal’s activities, from cellular processes to movement of the whole animal, depend on adequate sources of chemical energy in the diet. This energy is used to produce ATP, which powers processes from growth and development to moving and keeping warm. This continuous need for ATP is met by ingesting and digesting food made up of carbohydrates, protein, and lipids, any of which can be broken down to produce ATP.

As discussed in Chapter 2, there is ecological significance in the fact that heterotrophs (or consumers) must meet their energy and biomass-building needs entirely through the ingestion of organic matter created by other organisms. Since so much of the energy in the plant material consumed by animals is used for basic metabolism and maintenance, the overall efficiency of the conversion of plant biomass to animal biomass is quite low. At the most, about 10% of the energy stored in plant matter from photosynthesis is converted to animal biomass (see Figure 2.2). Conversion of the biomass of herbivorous animals to the biomass of carnivores is similarly inefficient. The consequences of this energy “loss” between trophic levels, and hence the energy footprint it creates, will be discussed in Chapter 19.

In addition to energy-containing compounds, an herbivore’s diet must also contain all of the raw materials needed

for biosynthesis. Two types of organic precursors are needed in large amounts to assemble the complex molecules an animal needs to grow, maintain itself, and reproduce: a source of organic carbon (such as sugar or carbohydrate) and a source of organic nitrogen (such as protein). These materials are the major building blocks for the great variety of organic molecules that make up animal biomass. Other elements are needed in smaller amounts: sulfur for the assembly of some amino acids, phosphorus for the production of nucleic acids, iron for making hemoglobin, and iodine for thyroid hormones.

All animals have limits to the kinds of macromolecules

they can synthesize from organic carbon and nitrogen and other elements. For example, animals can only synthesize about half of the 20 amino acids that they need to make protein. The amino acids that animals cannot synthesize must be obtained from food; these are called the essential amino acids. Most animals require eight amino acids in their diet for proper nutrition. The protein in the food products produced by animals, such as meat, cheese, and eggs, contains all of the essential amino acids, and is therefore called “complete” protein. Plant protein usually lacks several of the essential amino acids and is therefore called “incomplete” protein. For example, corn is deficient in tryptophan and lysine, and beans are deficient in methionine. (Putting the two together is a way for an animal on a vegetarian diet to obtain all of the essential amino acids.)

Another class of organic molecule that animals are unable to synthesize is fatty acids. For this reason they are also classified as essential. Linoleic acid is a good example of a fatty acid that humans and other animals cannot make, but which is supplied by the seeds, grains, and vegetables that are part of a balanced diet. Vitamins are another important category of

**156** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

organic molecule that cannot be synthesized. Each vitamin, be it water soluble or fat soluble, has a different but important role, ranging from functioning as a coenzyme in various metabolic processes to allowing blood to clot. Animals vary in their need for vitamins in their diets, however, because there is variation in their synthetic abilities. For example, most animals can synthesize vitamin C, but it is an essential nutrient for humans, guinea pigs, and some birds, because these animals are unable to make it in their bodies.

Finally, animals require certain minerals—such as sodium and potassium—that are needed not for synthesis of macromolecules, but for their role in osmotic balance and the transmission of nerve impulses.

All of these essential nutrients—along with the water that functions as the essential solvent and without which life

could not exist—form the foundation for developing proper diets for the animals upon which agriculture has come to depend.

As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, the domesticated animals that humans use for production of food and fiber have widely varying physiological makeups. Based on the evolution and adaptation it underwent prior to domestication, each type of animal has a particular type of digestive system adapted to the eating of a particular kind of diet. Domestication and selective breeding have not greatly altered these fundamental physiological and anatomical aspects of the animals we use for production of meat, milk, eggs, fiber, and other products.

The “natural” diets of domesticated animals matter a great deal when it comes to using these animals for food and fiber production in agroecosystems. Just as agroecosystem managers need to take into account crop plants’ different ranges of tolerance for various environmental conditions and their

different nutritional needs, so too do they need to consider how animals’ basic physiologies fit them to certain roles in production systems.

Ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats, with their multi-chambered stomachs and ability to harness bacterial enzymes in digestion, have the remarkable ability to digest the complex carbohydrate cellulose. They are adapted to grazing or browsing, both of which involve eating large volumes of plant matter composed largely of cellulose, which humans cannot digest. In this regard, ruminants perform a vital function from the human standpoint: they convert undigestible, non-nutritive biomass into biomass (meat and milk) that is not only edible, but also extraordinarily high in protein.

In industrial agriculture, however, this highly useful attribute of ruminant physiology is ignored in favor of a single-minded focus on the efficient production of the final product. In the confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) discussed in Chapter 1, cattle are no longer fed

plant matter that resembles what they ate naturally or even in improved pasture systems. Feed high in energy and protein, made up of corn grain and soybeans, takes the place of grass and legumes. This has several negative consequences including digestive disorders in the animals, high emissions of methane, and accumulation of large volumes of urine and manure. Further, the crop systems used to produce this feed are most often large-scale monocultures, with all of the problems of scale and ecological impacts that go along with them. The link between animal production and crop production is extremely close, but as we will see, an agroecological approach would be to return to integrated farming systems that better mix crops and animals in systems where both create a sustainable interdependence. Such systems will be discussed in Chapter 19.

Two of the domesticated animals most widely used for food—pigs and chickens—are omnivores. These animals are able to consume leaves, stems, fruit, and seeds, yet can take advantage of animal-based foods as the opportunity presents itself. This breadth of diet can have many advantages in agroecosystems. Pigs, for example, can be pastureraised on diverse plantings of grasses and legumes, yet while they are grazing they are also rooting in the soil for insects, earthworms, and the occasional rodent they might encounter. Pigs can also be raised in forests, where they do very well eating leaves, fungus, grubs, roots, nuts, earthworms, and fruit. With similarly broad diets and foraging ability but less impactful digging behavior, chickens can be successfully integrated into a variety of small-scale agroecosystems, eating plant pests, leaving nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich manure, and providing either eggs or meat or both. They are used in this way, for example, in the home garden systems described in Chapter 18.

As they have for cattle, however, modern-day CAFOs for hogs have shifted the animals entirely to a plant-based diet, with issues and problems similar to those described for cattle. Chickens and turkeys are also raised in industrial-scale confinement systems on diets primarily made up of corn and soybean grain. Although selective breeding has produced poultry breeds able to withstand grain-based diets without ill effect, raising the birds in confinement systems ignores the ecological benefits of their omnivory.

Various other animals are used in agroecosystems, not just for their ability to produce food but also because of the important ecological roles they play. Fish, for example, have been used in traditional rice-paddy systems in Asia for millennia. They are harvested for food, but also play important roles in controlling pests and cycling nutrients. Even insects are integrated into agroecosystems to produce useful products and serve important functions—honeybees and silkworms are two good examples. We will look more closely at the ecology of integrated plant–animal agroecosystems in Chapter 19.

Table 13.1 summarizes some of the attributes of domesti cated animals that should be considered in the design of sustainable animal production and integrated agroecosystems.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. What are the agroecological differences between

protein obtained from plant sources and protein from animal sources?

2. Today there is a lot of interest in producing beef on

pasture grass, rather than in feedlots. Describe some of the benefits gained from doing this. 3. How can we design agroecosystems so that obligate

mutualisms between heterotrophs and their plant partners can play an important role in food system sustainability? 4. How might one design an agroecosystem that would

make it possible to raise wild animals for human consumption?
