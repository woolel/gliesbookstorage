## _Section IV_ _System-Level Interactions_

With a grounding in the autecological knowledge developed in Sections II and III, we can now expand our perspective to the _synecological_ level—the study of how groups of organisms interact in the cropping environment. This whole-system perspective stresses the need for understanding the emergent qualities of populations, communities, and ecosystems and how these qualities are put to use in designing and managing sustainable agroecosystems.

Chapters 14 and 15 begin at the population level, exploring the population ecology of mixtures of species in the crop environment and the management of genetic resources. Chapter 16 examines species interactions at the community level, explaining the benefits of complexity and the role of

cooperation and mutualisms in sustainable agriculture. Chapters 17 and 18 cover a range of important ecological phenomena—including diversity, resilience, disturbance, and succession—that function at the ecosystem level, showing how these emergent qualities of whole systems are key aspects of agroecosystem design and management. Chapter 19 adds animals into the agroecosystem picture, looking at how livestock and other animals can play important ecological roles in sustainable food production. To conclude our exploration of system-level interactions, Chapter 20 examines whole-system function from the standpoint of energy use and flow and then Chapter 21 looks at how the core principle of diversity can be extended to agricultural landscapes.
