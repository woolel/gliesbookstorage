## chapter 1. Case for Fundamental Change in Agriculture

According to a variety of measures, agriculture, considered on a global scale, posted a long streak of extraordinary successes beginning shortly after World War II. During the latter half of the twentieth century, yields per hectare of staple crops such as wheat and rice increased dramatically, food prices declined, the rate of increase in food production generally exceeded the rate of population growth, and chronic hunger diminished. This boost in food production was due mainly to scientific advances and technological innovations, including the development of new plant varieties, the use of fertilizers and pesticides, and the growth of extensive infrastructures for irrigation, all of which contributed to the development of what we will call _industrial agriculture_ .

Although agriculture on a global scale has more recently struggled to maintain the ever-improving trends for yield increases, food price reductions, and hunger diminishment that it achieved in the twentieth century, it remains extraordinarily productive, providing abundant food for a large proportion of the world’s people. Because industrial agricultural has done a superb job of “delivering the goods,” many people in the developed and developing worlds have come to take food for granted. When supermarket shelves are always stocked with a cornucopia of edible products, people tend not to devote a great deal of thought to what it takes to get the food onto the shelves. In historical perspective, this is really an unprecedented situation. Ever since _Homo sapiens_ arose some hundreds of thousands of years ago, most humans have had to put the source of their next meals at the top of their list of concerns. But while having a relative abundance of food is a good thing compared to its opposite, it has tended to desensitize us to food issues, to make those of us with good access to food uncritical about how food comes to be.

Ironically, this is precisely the time in our species’ history when we need to be taking stock of our food system with a more critical eye than ever before. Just because industrial agriculture is able to create food abundance in the present does not mean it will be able to do so over the long term. Indeed, it is time we came to the realization that industrial agriculture’s productivity comes at a steep price and that the bill is eventually going to come due. To create the food productivity that we take for granted today, the industrial system of food production is sacrificing the basic foundations of agriculture—fertile soil, available moisture, amenable climate, nutrient recycling, genetic diversity, and the ecosystem services of natural systems. These prerequisites of food production can take only so much abuse before they begin to fail, putting at risk the food supply of tomorrow.

Another way of describing the situation is that the industrial agriculture model that dominates agriculture today is at the core of a fundamental contradiction: the techniques, innovations, practices, and policies that constitute industrial agriculture, and which have played the largest role in increasing agricultural productivity, have also undermined the basis for that productivity. They have overdrawn and degraded the natural resources upon which agriculture depends. They have created a dependence on nonrenewable, increasingly costly fossil fuels, the use of which exacerbates climate change. And they have helped to forge a system that concentrates ownership of food-system infrastructure in the hands of a few while taking it away from farmers and farmworkers, those who are in the best position to be stewards of agricultural land. In short, the contradictions inherent in our industrial agriculture-dominated system of food production make it unsustainable—it cannot continue to produce enough food for the growing global population over the long term because it deteriorates the conditions that make agriculture possible.

At the same time, our world food system faces threats not entirely of its own making, most notably the emergence of new agricultural diseases, rising costs for all the physical factors of production (land, water, energy, inputs), and climate change. As currently configured, the global food system is terribly ill equipped to face these threats. Increasingly, experts are raising red flags about the ability of agriculture worldwide to adapt to an earth on which droughts, heat waves, and extreme weather events become commonplace and the entire biosphere undergoes major shifts with potentially severe consequences for the growing of food.

Although how we feed ourselves is among humankind’s weightiest issues, there is a conspicuous lack of consensus on the current status of the world food system and its future sustainability. A large number of experts—policy analysts, economists, scientists, researchers, and even some business leaders—agree with the rough outlines of the view just presented (e.g., IAASTD 2009; IFAD 2013). They believe that the industrial methods that dominate the world food system today are causing great harm to people and to earth’s lifesupport systems and cannot (and should not) be sustained. But as numerous and authoritative as they are, these voices of concern are drowned out by those who predict productivity increases into the distant future and advocate for intensification and further dissemination of the very same methods and technologies singled out by critics of industrial agriculture as being most harmful.

The causes of this crucial difference of opinion will be addressed in the final section of this book (Section VI).

**4** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

In the meantime, we encourage readers to entertain the critical perspective with which this chapter began and be open to the possibility that the world food system, as productive as it is, does in fact undermine the foundations of food production and needs to be replaced by something fundamentally different.

The first step in this direction is to take a broad and critical look at the practices of present-day agriculture—that is, to examine the largely hidden costs associated with the remarkable yields we have been extracting from the world’s agricultural lands.

**PRACTICES OF INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE**

Present-day agriculture is built around two related goals: the maximization of production and the maximization of profit. These goals give agriculture a striking resemblance to the manufacturing processes that occur in factories. In both cases, elements of production are reduced to their simplest forms, processes are mechanized so that they can brought under the full control of human operators, and efficiency of output in relation to input crowds out any other goals. Although this form of agriculture is often called _conven-_ _tional_ to distinguish it from so-called _organic_ agriculture, its factory-like nature suggests the more descriptive term used in the introduction to this chapter: _industrial agriculture_ .

In pursuit of maximum production and profit, a host of practices have been developed in industrial agriculture without regard for their direct social and environmental costs or their unintended, long-term consequences. Seven basic practices—intensive tillage, monoculture, irrigation, application of inorganic fertilizer, chemical pest control, genetic manipulation of domesticated plants and animals, and “factory farming” of animals—form the backbone of modern industrial agriculture. Each is used for its individual contribution to productivity, but as a whole the practices form a system in which each depends on the others and reinforces the necessity of using all in concert.

**I** **ntensive** **T** **illage**

Industrial agriculture has long been based on the practice of cultivating the soil completely, deeply, and regularly. The purpose of this intensive cultivation is to loosen the soil structure to allow better drainage, faster root growth, aeration, incorporation of crop residues, and easier sowing of seed. Cultivation is also used to control weeds. Under typical practices—that is, when intensive tillage is combined with short rotations—fields are plowed or cultivated several times during the year, and in many cases this leaves the soil free of any cover for extended periods. It also means that heavy machinery makes regular and frequent passes over fields.

Ironically, intensive cultivation tends to degrade soil quality in a variety of ways. Soil organic matter is reduced as a result of accelerated decomposition and the lack of cover, and the soil is compacted by the recurring traffic of machinery. The loss of organic matter reduces soil fertility and degrades

soil structure, increasing the likelihood of further compaction and making cultivation and its temporary improvements even more necessary. Intensive cultivation also greatly increases rates of soil erosion by water and wind.

In recent years, some farmers have turned to reducedtillage or so-called no-tillage practices. No-till systems have reduced some of the negative impacts of intensive tillage, but as currently practiced they depend on herbicides for weed control. Since herbicide application has its own set of negative consequences (see Chemical Pest and Weed Control below) and because no-till systems reduce the input of organic material into the soil, this system is really just trading one set of problems for another.

**M** **onoculture**

Over the last century, agriculture all over the world has moved relentlessly toward specialization. Farming once meant growing a diversity of crops and raising livestock, but now farmers are far more likely to specialize, growing corn for livestock feed, for example, or raising hogs. In crop agriculture, specialization means monoculture—growing only one crop in a field, often on a very extensive scale. Monoculture allows more efficient use of farm machinery for cultivation, sowing, weed control, and harvest, and can create economies of scale with regard to purchase of seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides. Monoculture is a natural outgrowth of an industrial approach to agriculture, where labor inputs are minimized and technology-based inputs are maximized in order to increase productive efficiency. Monoculture techniques mesh well with the other practices of modern agriculture: monoculture tends to favor intensive cultivation, application of inorganic fertilizer, irrigation, chemical control of pests and weeds, and specialized plant varieties. The link with chemical pesticides is particularly strong; vast fields of the same plant are more susceptible to devastating attack by specific pests and diseases and require protection by pesticides. Many of the same problems occur when farmers plant large areas to organic monocultures.

**A** **pplication** **of** **S** **ynthetic** **F** **ertilizer**

The spectacular increases in yields of the last half of the twentieth century were due in large part to the widespread and intensive use of synthetic chemical fertilizers. In the United States, the amount of fertilizer applied to fields each year increased rapidly after World War II, from 9 million tons in 1940 to more than 47 million tons in 1980. Although worldwide use of fertilizer increased most rapidly between 1950 and 1992, continuing increases in use since that period brought total world consumption of synthetic fertilizer beyond the 170-million-metric-ton mark in 2007 (FAOSTAT 2012).

Produced in large quantities at relatively low cost using fossil fuels, atmospheric nitrogen (N 2 ), and mined mineral deposits containing phosphorus (P), fertilizers can be applied easily and uniformly to crops to supply them with ample amounts of the most essential plant nutrients. Because they

Case for Fundamental Change in Agriculture **5**

meet plants’ nutrient needs for the short term, fertilizers have allowed farmers to ignore long-term soil fertility and the processes by which it is maintained.

The mineral components of synthetic fertilizers, however, are easily leached out of the soil. In irrigated systems, the leaching problem may be particularly acute; a large amount of the fertilizer applied to fields actually ends up in streams, lakes, and rivers, where it causes **eutrophication** (excessive growth of oxygen-depleting plant and algal life). Fertilizer can also be leached into groundwater used for drinking, where it poses a significant health hazard. Use of nitrogenbased fertilizer is furthermore a problem for the atmosphere: it stimulates soil microbes to produce more nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which acts as a greenhouse gas and depletes stratospheric ozone (Park et al. 2012). Finally, the cost of fertilizer is a variable over which farmers have no control since it rises

with increases in the cost of petroleum.

**I** **rrigation**

An adequate supply of water is the limiting factor for food production in many parts of the world. Thus supplying water to fields from underground aquifers, reservoirs, and diverted rivers has been key to increasing overall yield and the amount of land that can be farmed. Although only 20% of the world’s cropland is irrigated, this land produces 40% of the world’s food (FAO 2011).

All sectors of society have placed rapidly increasing demands on freshwater supplies over the past half century, but agricultural purposes account for the lion’s share of the demand—about 70% of water use worldwide (UN Water 2012). A clean, fresh, and sufficient supply of water has become a major issue on the immediate horizon not just for agriculture, but for all of human society (Pearce 2006). Unfortunately, agriculture is such a prodigious user of water that in many areas where land is irrigated for farming, irrigation has a significant effect on regional hydrology. The greatest problem is that groundwater is often pumped faster than it is renewed by rainfall. This overdraft can cause land subsidence, and near the coast it can lead to saltwater intrusion (Figure 1.1). In addition, overdrafting groundwater is essentially borrowing water from the future. Where water for irrigation is drawn from rivers, agriculture is often competing for water with water-dependent wildlife and urban areas. Dams built to hold water supplies have dramatic effects downstream on the ecology of rivers and block the spawning of anadromous fish. Irrigation has another type of impact as well: it increases the likelihood that fertilizers will be leached from fields and into local streams and rivers, and it can greatly increase the rate of soil erosion.

After World War II, chemical pesticides were widely touted as the new, scientific weapon in humankind’s war against plant pests and pathogens. These chemical agents had the appeal of offering farmers a way to rid their fields once and

for all of organisms that continually threatened their crops and literally ate up their profits. But this promise has proven to be false. Pesticides (i.e., insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides) can dramatically lower pest populations in the short term, but because they also kill pests’ natural enemies, pest populations can often quickly rebound and reach even greater numbers than before. The farmer is then forced to use even more of the chemical agents. The dependence on pesticide use that results has been called the “pesticide treadmill.” Augmenting the dependence problem is the phenomenon of increased resistance: pest populations continually exposed to pesticides are subjected to intense natural selection for pesticide resistance. When resistance among the pests increases, farmers are forced to apply larger amounts of pesticide or to use different pesticides, further contributing to the conditions that promote even greater resistance.

The metaphor of the “treadmill” is particularly apt because once a farmer gets on it, he or she finds it difficult to get off. With natural enemies eliminated from the system, ceasing to use pesticides is asking for serious crop damage. This is one reason why many farmers—especially those in developing nations—do not use other options, even though the problem of pesticide dependence is widely recognized. Even in the United States, the amount of pesticides applied to major field crops, fruits, and vegetables each year remains above 500,000 metric tons per year, more than twice the level it was in 1962, when Rachel Carson published _Silent Spring_ (US EPA 2012). Pesticide resistance, the spread of insect pests and plant pathogens to regions where they had not previously existed, and the extensive use of genetically modified

genome as their parents, making farmers dependent on commercial seed producers.

More recently, geneticists have developed techniques that allow them to splice genes from a variety of organisms into target genomes to create “customized” plant and animal varieties. These organisms are referred to as **transgenic**, GM, or **genetically engineered** (GE).

**FIGURE 1.2** **Broadcast spraying to control codling moth in an** **apple orchard in the Pajaro Valley, CA.**

(GM) crops _designed_ to be grown in concert with intensive application of herbicides (see the next section) are all factors driving the worldwide increase in the use of chemical pest and disease controls. Ironically, total crop losses to pests have stayed fairly constant for the past 40–50 years despite increasing pesticide use (Pimentel 2005; Oerke 2006).

Besides costing farmers a great deal of money, pesticides can have a profound effect on the environment and on human health. Worldwide, millions of people every year experience symptoms of direct pesticide poisoning, and the ubiquitous presence of pesticides in water, soil, and food is implicated in increased incidence of cancer, reproductive and developmental disorders, and other maladies. Pesticides applied to fields kill beneficial insects and those essential to natural system food webs, and they are easily washed and leached into surface water and groundwater, where they enter the food chain, affecting animal populations at every level and often persisting for decades.

Humans have selected for specific characteristics among crop plants and domesticated animals for thousands of years; indeed, human management of wild species was one of the foundations of the beginning of agriculture. In recent decades, however, technological advances have brought about a revolution in the manipulation of genes. First, advances in breeding techniques allowed for the production of hybrid seeds, which combine the characters of two or more plant strains. Hybrid plant varieties can be much more productive than similar nonhybrid varieties and have thus been one of the primary factors behind the yield increases achieved during the so-called “green revolution.” The hybrid varieties, however, often require optimal conditions—including intensive application of inorganic fertilizer—in order to realize their productive potential, and many require pesticide application to protect them from extensive pest damage because they lack the pest resistance of their nonhybrid cousins. In addition, hybrid plants cannot produce seeds with the same

Only a few animal species used for food have been genetically engineered as yet—these include pigs with spinach genes that produce lower-fat bacon, cows that produce milk with higher casein levels, and salmon that grow at twice the rate of their wild kin—but transgenic crop plants have become widespread and very important in agricultural production. Between 1996 and 2012, the area planted to GE crops worldwide increased 100-fold, from 1.7 million hectares to over 170 million hectares, making “biotech” crops “the fastest adopted crop technology in the history of modern agriculture” (James 2012). Although developed countries have long been the leaders in production of biotech crops—69.5 million hectares were planted in the United States in 2012, for example—developing countries are now adopting the crops at a faster rate. The area planted to biotech crops in developing countries surpassed that in developed countries in 2012.

Two types of GM crops have become particularly prevalent: those engineered to be tolerant of herbicides and those containing genes directing the plants to produce the same insecticidal toxins produced by the bacterium _Bacillus_ _thuringiensis_ (“Bt crops”). Herbicide-tolerant crops are designed to be treated with herbicides—usually glyphosate—to kill weeds but not the crop plants; Bt crops protect themselves from herbivory, reducing the need for insecticides. Together, these crops account for about 95% of the acres planted to cotton and soybean in the United States and about 85% of the acres planted to corn (Benbrook 2012).

Although GE organisms hold many promises—reducing the use of pesticides and irrigation, allowing agriculture on soils too saline for normal crops, and increasing the nutritional value of some crops—there are many concerns about the spread of this and related biotechnologies. One main source of concern is the potential for the migration of modified genes into other populations, both wild and domestic. This could result, for example, in more aggressive weeds or the introduction of toxins into crop plants. In the case of the modified salmon mentioned earlier, the fish could easily escape and cross with wild salmon, possibly upsetting ocean food chains. Increased use of transgenic crops may also diminish agrobiodiversity, as traditional cultivars are abandoned, and increase the dependence of farmers on the transnational corporations owning the patents on the new organisms.

The rapid rise to dominance of herbicide-tolerant and Bt crops in US agriculture has revealed what may be one of the most serious drawbacks of GM food organisms: in both cases, the target pests—weeds for herbicide-tolerant crops and insects for Bt crops—become resistant, creating yet another version of the pesticide treadmill. Many weed

Case for Fundamental Change in Agriculture **7**

species have quickly become resistant to glyphosate, forcing farmers planting herbicide-resistant crops to increase application of glyphosate, spray it more often, and add in other herbicides that have a different mode of action (and are often more toxic to humans). Because of this “super weed” phenomenon, herbicide use in the United States increased exponentially between 1996 and 2011; US farmers now use 527 million more pounds of herbicide than they did in 1996 (Benbrook 2012). Although Bt crops have, during the same period, reduced insecticide use moderately, insect pests have become increasingly resistant to Bt toxins, causing farmers to bring back the insecticides they used in the past in order to preserve the efficacy of Bt technology. Moreover, the large amounts of Bt toxin produced by Bt crops cause the toxin to appear in ever-higher amounts in animal feed, human food, and the environment.

**F** **actory** **F** **arming** **of** **A** **nimals**

If you live in a developed country, a large portion of the meat, eggs, and milk that you eat probably comes from large-scale, industrialized operations driven by the goal of bringing these food products to market at the lowest possible unit cost. The animals in these “confined animal feeding operations” (CAFOs) are typically crowded so tightly they can barely move, given antibiotics to prevent the spread of disease, and fed highly processed soy- and corn-based feed supplemented with hormones and vitamins. Even though they are completely dependent on crop agriculture for the production of feed, CAFOs are disconnected—spatially and functionally—from the fields in which the feed grains are grown (Figure 1.3).

Factory-farm livestock production is another manifestation of the specialization trend in agriculture. In many ways, factory farming is for pigs, cattle, and poultry while monoculture is for corn, wheat, and tomatoes. The livestock in CAFOs are more susceptible to disease, just as monocropped corn plants are to pest damage, and both require chemical inputs (pharmaceuticals for livestock and pesticides for

crops) to compensate. Both factory farming and monoculture encourage the use of organisms bred or engineered for productive efficiency and dependent on the artificial conditions of the industrial process.

Factory farming is criticized by animal rights groups as cruel and inhumane. Laying hens and broiler chickens are routinely debeaked to keep them from pecking each other; hogs are often kept in pens so small they cannot turn around; beef cattle commonly suffer slow and painful deaths at the slaughterhouse.

There are many other reasons to be critical of the industrial approach to raising livestock. CAFOs, for example, have serious impacts on the environment. Disposal of the massive amounts of manure and urine generated by the confined animals is a huge problem, usually dealt with by treating the wastes in large anaerobic lagoons that leak nitrates into surface streams and groundwater and allow ammonia to escape into the atmosphere. This problem arises because CAFOs by their very nature cannot recycle nitrogen within the system, as is the case on smaller traditional farms where animals and

crop plants are raised together. Thus nitrogen becomes a problematic waste product instead of a valuable plant nutrient.

The rise in factory farming is coupled with a worldwide trend toward diets higher in meat and animal products. As demand for meat increases, industrialized methods of animal food production become more profitable and more widespread, replacing more sustainable pastoral and mixed crop–livestock systems.

**WHY INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE**

**IS NOT SUSTAINABLE**

The practices of industrial agriculture all tend to compromise future productivity in favor of high productivity in the present. The ways in which industrial agriculture puts future productivity at risk are many. Agricultural resources such as soil, water, and genetic diversity are overdrawn and degraded, global ecological processes on which agriculture ultimately depends are altered, human health suffers, and the social conditions conducive to resource conservation are

weakened and dismantled. In economic terms, these adverse impacts are called **externalized costs** . Because their consequences can be temporarily ignored or absorbed by society in general, they are excluded from the cost–benefit calculus that allows industrial agricultural operations to continue to make economic sense.

An important feature of industrial agriculture’s externalized costs is that they have serious consequences both for the future and the present. These “unsustainable” aspects of industrial agriculture are not problematic just because they are unsustainable—because they will one day cause the system to collapse—but because they are causing, in the present, real human suffering and irreparable damage to the ecological systems on which we rely. They are also problematic because when they do begin to pull industrial agriculture into a state of crisis, agriculture would not be the only part of **FIGURE 1.3** **A CAFO in California’s Central Valley.** human society that will be impacted.

**S** **oil** **D** **egradation**

Every year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), between five and seven million hectares of valuable agricultural land are lost to soil degradation. Other estimates run as high as 10 million hectares per year (e.g., World Congress on Conservation Agriculture 2005). In 2011, the FAO estimated that 33% of the earth’s land is highly or moderately degraded, with the majority of this land in areas with high poverty rates (FAO 2011). Degradation of soil can involve salting, waterlogging, compaction, contamination by pesticides, decline in the quality of soil structure, loss of fertility, and erosion by wind and water.

Although all these forms of soil degradation are severe problems, erosion is the most widespread. Under optimal conditions, soil is created at the rate of about 1 ton/ ha/year, but worldwide soil is being eroded from industrially farmed land at a rate one to two orders of magnitude greater (Montgomery 2007). This means that in just a short period, humans have wasted soil resources that took thousands of

years to be built up (Figure 1.4).

The cause–effect relationship between industrial agriculture and soil erosion is direct and unambiguous. Intensive tillage, combined with monoculture and short rotations, leaves the soil exposed to the erosive effects of wind and rain. The soil lost through this process is rich in organic matter, the most valuable soil component. Similarly, irrigation is a direct cause of much water erosion of agricultural soil.

Combined, soil erosion and the other forms of soil degradation render much of the agricultural soil of the world

**FIGURE 1.4** **Severe soil erosion on a sloping hillside follow-** **ing intense winter rains.** In this strawberry-growing region in the Elkhorn Slough watershed of central California, soil losses exceed 150 tons/acre in some years.

increasingly less fertile. Some land—severely eroded or too salty from evaporated irrigation water—is lost from production altogether. The land that can still produce is kept productive by the artificial means of adding synthetic fertilizers. Although fertilizers can temporarily replace lost nutrients, they cannot rebuild soil fertility and restore soil health; moreover, their use has a number of negative consequences, as discussed earlier.

Since the supply of agricultural soil is finite, and because natural processes cannot come close to renewing or restoring soil as fast as it is degraded, agriculture cannot be sustainable until it can reverse the process of soil degradation. Current agricultural practices must undergo a vast change if the precious soil resources we have remaining are to be conserved for the future.

Freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce in many parts of the world as industry, expanding cities, and agriculture compete for limited supplies. Some countries have too little water for any additional agricultural or industrial development to occur. To meet demands for water in many other places, water is being drawn from underground aquifers much faster than it can be replenished by rainfall, and rivers are being drained of their water to the detriment of aquatic and riparian ecosystems and their dependent wildlife. Many of the world’s major rivers—including the Colorado, Ganges, and Yellow— now run dry for part of the year as a result.

Agriculture accounts for more than 70% of global water use. Most of this water is used to irrigate crops. For the most part, irrigation is employed not to make land productive, but to make it _more_ productive. The 20% of agricultural land worldwide that is irrigated produces about 40% of the world’s food supply (FAO 2011). To generate this considerable increase in yield beyond what would otherwise be the case, irrigated agriculture uses tremendous volumes of water.

Irrigated agriculture uses so much water in part because it uses water wastefully. More than half of the water applied to crops is never taken up by the plants it is intended for (Van Tuijl 1993). Instead, this water either evaporates from the soil surface or drains out of fields. Some wastage of water is inevitable, but a great deal of waste could be eliminated if agricultural practices were oriented toward conservation of water rather than maximization of production. For example, crop plants could be watered with drip irrigation systems, and production of water-intensive crops such as rice could be shifted away from regions with limited water supplies.

The increasing importance of meat in human diets worldwide is another factor in agriculture’s rising demand for water, as is the trend toward concentrated grain feeding of livestock. Animal factories use a great deal of water for cooling the animals and flushing their wastes, and many animals drink large amounts of water. Hogs, for example, can consume up to 8 gal/animal/day (Marks and Knuffke 1998). And these are

Case for Fundamental Change in Agriculture **9**

just the direct uses of water for raising livestock. Factoring in the water needed to grow the biomass fed to animals, animal-derived food requires at least twice as much water to produce as plant-derived food, and usually much more. The difference between the amount of water needed to grow calorie-equivalent amounts of plant food and animal food can be extreme. For example, it takes only 89 L of water to grow 500 cal of potatoes, but an astonishing _fifty-five times_ more, or 4902 L, to raise 500 cal of grain-fed beef (Postel and Vickers 2004). If we look at protein alone, the ratio is even more skewed: on average, producing 1 kg of animal protein requires about 100 times as much water as producing 1 kg of grain protein (Pimentel and Pimentel 2003).

In addition to using a large share of the world’s freshwater, industrial agriculture has an impact on regional and global hydrological patterns and the aquatic, riparian, and marine ecosystems dependent on them. First, by drawing such large quantities of water from natural reservoirs on land, agriculture has caused a massive transfer of water from the continents to the oceans. A 2012 study concluded that an observed sea level rise of 0.77 mm/year between 1961 and 2003, about 42% of the total rise, was due to the transfer of water from on-land storage basins to the sea. Most of this transfer is due to the use of underground aquifers for irrigation (Pokhrel et al. 2012). Moreover, the amount of water that agriculture causes to be moved from the land to the oceans is only increasing as more land is brought under irrigation. Second, where irrigation is practiced on a large scale, agriculture brings about changes in hydrology and microclimate. Water is transferred from natural watercourses to fields and the soil below them, and increased evaporation changes humidity levels and may affect rainfall patterns. These changes in turn significantly impact natural ecosystems and wildlife. Third, the dams, aqueducts, and other infrastructure created to make irrigation possible have dramatically altered many of the world’s rivers, causing enormous ecological damage. Rivers that once provided valuable ecosystem services to human society cannot do so anymore—their wetland, aquatic, and floodplain ecosystems can no longer absorb and filter out pollutants or provide habitat for fish and waterfowl, and they can no longer deposit the rich sediment so important for restoring the fertility of agricultural soils in floodplain areas (Figure 1.5).

Agriculture’s large and growing use of water will only grow more serious as a fundamental issue facing humankind. As the demand for water increases, the guarantee of an adequate supply becomes less and less assured because climate change is reducing mountain snowfall, melting high-altitude glaciers, increasing the frequency of droughts, causing salinization of groundwater in coastal areas, and degrading the ecosystem processes that help purify water. If industrial agriculture continues to use water in the same ways, our rivers will become increasingly crippled and regional water crises will become increasingly common, either shortchanging the environment, marginalized peoples, and future generations or limiting irrigationdependent food production.

**FIGURE 1.5** **The San Luis Dam in California.** Built in part to hold irrigation water for farms on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, it is one of an estimated 800,000 dams in the world that trap life-giving silt, destroy riverine and riparian ecosystems, and completely alter natural hydrological functioning.

**P** **ollution** **of** **the** **E** **nvironment**

More water pollution comes from agriculture than from any other single source. Agricultural pollutants include pesticides, herbicides, other agrochemicals, fertilizer, animal wastes, and salts.

Pesticides and herbicides—applied in large quantities on a regular basis, often from aircraft—are easily spread beyond their targets, killing beneficial insects and wildlife directly and poisoning farmers and farmworkers. The pesticides that make their way into streams, rivers, and lakes—and eventually the ocean—can have serious deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems. They can also affect other ecosystems indirectly. Fish-eating raptors, for example, may eat pesticide-laden fish, reducing their reproductive capacity and thereby impacting terrestrial ecosystems. Although persistent organochloride pesticides such as DDT—known for their ability to remain in ecosystems for many decades— are being used less in many parts of the world, their lesspersistent replacements are often much more acutely toxic.

Pesticides also pose a significant human health hazard. They spread throughout the environment by hydrological, meteorological, and biological means, and so it is impossible for humans to avoid exposure. In its 2003 edition of _Human_ _Exposure to Environmental Chemicals_, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that all of the 9282 people they tested had pesticides and their breakdown products in their bodies, and the average person had detectable amounts of 13 different pesticides (Schafer et al. 2004). Similar incidences of exposure and detection were reported in the CDC’s 2013 report (CDC 2013). Pesticides enter our bodies through our food and our drinking water. In one study (Gilliom and Hamilton 2006), pesticide contamination was detected in 97% of streams tested in agricultural and urban areas, in 94% of streams tested in areas with mixed land use, and in 65% of

**10** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

streams tested in undeveloped areas. Pesticides were found in 61% of groundwater samples in agricultural areas and 55% of samples in urban areas. Another study (Wu et al. 2010) found that the herbicide atrazine, which is used very commonly for corn production, was present in 75% of all watersheds and 40% of the drinking water wells in corn-producing regions of the United States, and estimates that over 33 million people in the United States have been exposed to atrazine in their drinking water. If all the drinking water sources in the United States at risk for pesticide contamination were properly monitored for the presence of harmful agents, the cost would be well over $15 billion (Pimentel 2005).

Fertilizer leached from fields is less directly toxic than pesticides, but its effects can be equally damaging ecologically. In aquatic and marine ecosystems it promotes the overgrowth of algae, causing eutrophication and the death of many types of organisms. Nitrates from fertilizers and livestock manure are also a major contaminant of drinking water in many areas. When nitrates enter aquifers they are not easily removed, and frequently alternative drinking water sources are not available. As a result, many people in agricultural regions are exposed to nitrate levels in excess of established safe thresholds and have an increased risk of cancer

and reproductive disorders. Rounding out the list of pollutants from croplands are salts and sediments, which in many locales have degraded streams, helped destroy fisheries, and rendered wetlands unfit for bird life.

Where factory farming has become the dominant form of meat, milk, and egg production, animal waste has become a huge pollution problem. Farm animals in the United States produce far more waste than do humans. The large size of feedlot and other factory farming operations poses challenges for the treatment of these wastes. As noted in the previous text, the wastes are typically treated in large anaerobic lagoons not well suited to protection of the environment. Some of the nitrogen from the wastes leaks out of the lagoons and into underlying aquifers, adding large quantities of nitrates to the groundwater and eventually to rivers. Even more nitrogen from the wastes converts to ammonia and enters the atmo sphere, where it combines with water droplets to form ammonium ions. As a result, the rainwater downwind of livestock feeding operations often has extremely high concentrations of ammonium ions. Although most treated animal waste is ultimately applied to fields as fertilizer, the phosphorus and nitrogen it contains are beyond useful levels for most crops. Furthermore, factory farms often have so much waste to get rid of that they apply more treated waste to fields than the soil can accommodate, and do so year-round, even at times in the crop cycle when fields and crops are unable to absorb it. The excess nitrogen and phosphorus find their way into streams, rivers, and the local drinking water supply.

Through all these various avenues, tons of nitrogen and phosphorus from animal waste and inorganic fertilizer make their way into waterways and then into the oceans, creating large “dead zones” near river mouths. More than 50 of these dead zones exist seasonally around the world, with some of the largest—in the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, and Gulf

of Mexico—off the coast of the United States. In the sum mer of 2013, the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico reached a record-breaking size of more than 8000 square miles.

Farming entails the conversion of native vegetation—the habitat for native species of insects, birds, mammals, and other animals—into land intensively managed by humans. That is the nature of agriculture and the price of supporting large populations of human beings on the earth. But different forms of agriculture have vastly different impacts on native vegetation and natural habitat. As will be discussed in Chapter 23, land managed by humans for food production can support healthy populations of beneficial insects, birds, and other vertebrates and invertebrates, serving in this regard as a reasonable substitute for the natural habitats that once

existed on the land. For a variety of reasons, industrial agriculture has proven remarkably effective at not only eliminating vast expanses of native vegetation but also at essentially sterilizing agricultural land and reducing its habitat value to essentially zero.

Industrial agriculture supports a drive to convert as much natural habitat as possible to farmland because more land in production means more profit. More often than not, farmers expand their areas of production not to grow more food for people, but to grow more corn and other agricultural commodities for biofuel production and animal feed. In the United States, conversion of additional land to corn production has been directly linked to a rise in the price of corn, which is a product of federal subsidies for biofuel production.

All the practices of industrial agriculture described earlier combine to make the large bulk of cropland in many areas essentially worthless as wildlife habitat. Intensively tilled monocultures of genetically uniform crops fertilized with inorganic fertilizers can serve as a habitat for very few animals except insect pests, and in attempting to control these pests with pesticides, industrially oriented farmers insure that other insects are eliminated as well. More recently, the development of herbicide-resistant crop varieties has allowed farmers to escalate their war against weeds to a new level, creating vast stretches of agricultural landscape with no refuges for beneficial insects and no food plants for migrating populations of butterflies.

The effects of eliminating natural vegetation and reducing the habitat value of agricultural land may be slow to accumulate, but there is little doubt that they may become severe. Some of the effects will be felt directly by agroecosystems, as pollinators such as European and native bees become scarce and reductions in populations of natural enemies of insect pests make farmers more dependent on pesticides. But even more worrisome are the larger-scale effects, which include precipitous declines in biological diversity and deterioration of ecosystems that provide farmers and other humans with critical ecosystem services (such as water purification, buffering of floods, groundwater recharge, and erosion control).

Industrial agriculture has achieved its high yields mainly by increasing agricultural inputs. These inputs comprise physical factors of production such as irrigation water, fertilizer, pesticides, and processed feed and antibiotics; the energy used to manufacture these substances, to run farm machinery and irrigation pumps, and to climate-control animal factories; technology in the form of hybrid and transgenic seeds, new farm machinery, and new agrochemicals; and knowledge in the form of the expertise needed to use and manage these inputs. These inputs all come from outside the agroecosystem itself; their extensive use has consequences for farmers’ profits, use of nonrenewable resources, and the locus of control of agricultural production (Figure 1.7).

The longer industrial practices are used on farmland, the more the system becomes dependent on external inputs. As intensive tillage and monoculture degrade the soil, continued fertility depends more and more on the input of fossilfuel-derived nitrogen fertilizer and other nutrients. And using reduced-tillage systems to limit the problems caused by intensive tillage does nothing to break this dependency because it usually requires that intensive herbicide use take the place of tillage as a weed control method.

Agriculture cannot be sustained as long as this dependence on external inputs remains. First, the natural resources from which many of the inputs are derived are nonrenewable and their supplies finite. Second, dependence on external inputs leaves farmers, regions, and whole countries vulnerable to supply shortages, market fluctuations, and price increases. In addition, excessive use of inputs has multiple negative offfarm and downstream impacts, as noted earlier.

The most notable of external inputs in industrial agriculture is fossil fuels. The dependence of industrial agriculture

**FIGURE 1.7** **Equipment yard of a large industrial vegetable** **farm in the Salinas Valley, CA.** High levels of external inputs are needed to level, rip, and cultivate soil, plant seeds or transplant seedlings, apply fertilizers, spray pesticides, irrigate, and harvest crops such as the monoculture broccoli seen in the foreground.

on fossil fuels has become so extreme—they are critical for everything from manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer to transport of food from one side of the globe to the other—that food prices have become correlated directly with energy prices. Although agriculture’s dependence on an input that will eventually be used up is a cause for concern, a continued flow of fossil fuels has been guaranteed for the medium term by the development of new extractive technologies such as “fracking” and the exploitation of deeper offshore oil fields. The same thing cannot be said, however, for another critical external input: phosphorus. Mined deposits of phosphorusrich minerals—the sole source of this important macronutrient in synthetic fertilizer—may be mostly used up within the next four decades.

As an economic sector, agriculture is the third largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, behind transportation and the burning of fossil fuels for power and heat. Although it is impossible to grow, process, and distribute food without releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, our present food system makes a much larger contribution to climate change than it would if organized according to agroecological principles. The geographic and economic separation between farmers and consumers insures the burning of large quantities of fossil fuels to distribute and transport food; input-intensive monoculture requires that fossil fuels be used to produce and distribute inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs and that farmers be dependent on fossil-fuel-consuming field equipment. Further, industrial agriculture’s primary focus on the maximization of yield and profit gives farmers little motivation to use fossil-fuel energy and the inputs derived from it efficiently. It is common, for example, for farmers to

**12** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

apply excess nitrogen fertilizer, much of which ends up as the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.

The food system’s focus on production of meat and dairy products is a major reason why agriculture produces so much greenhouse gas. Approximately 37% of agriculture’s total greenhouse gas emissions—in the form of the potent greenhouse gas methane—come from the digestive systems of the world’s livestock. Livestock are also responsible for much of agriculture’s emission of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. The nitrous oxide comes from bacterial processing of the nitrogen in livestock manure; the carbon dioxide comes from the rapid decomposition of crop residue in the tilled fields used to produce livestock feed.

In addition to producing greenhouse gases, industrial agriculture exacerbates climate change by reducing the ability of the biosphere to hold carbon in a fixed, organic form. At any particular moment, a significant portion of the carbon in circulation—that is, not locked away in geologic structures below the surface—is not in gaseous form in the atmosphere, but present as dissolved CO 2 in the oceans and in organic or mineral form in earth’s terrestrial ecosystems. This latter “sink” of carbon is largely made up of vegetative biomass and the microbial biomass, humus, and organic and mineral carbon of the soil. Industrial agriculture involves practices (described in Practices of Industrial Agriculture section) that reduce the storage capacity of both of these terrestrial carbon sinks. Much of this occurs in the clear ing of large tracts of woody vegetation—much of it tropical rainforest—for pasture land and for growing livestock feed, palm oil, and biofuel feedstock. Additionally, intensive tillage, application of inorganic fertilizer, and a strong reliance on annual crops dramatically reduce the ability of agricultural soils to sequester and store carbon because they reduce the soil’s biological activity and expose its organic matter to depletion by erosion, chemical degradation, and bacterial respiration.

In these many ways, industrial agriculture makes a significant contribution to climate change, thereby playing a role in making much of the earth less hospitable to agriculture in any form.

**L** **oss** **of** **G** **enetic** **D** **iversity**

Throughout most of the history of agriculture, humans have increased the genetic diversity of crop plants and livestock worldwide. We have been able to do this both by selecting for a variety of specific and often locally adapted traits through selective breeding, and by continually recruiting wild species and their genes into the pool of domesticated organisms. In the last 100 years or so, however, the overall genetic diversity of domesticated plants and animals has declined. Many varieties of plants and breeds of animals have become extinct, and a great many others are heading in that direction. About 75% of the genetic diversity that existed in crop plants in 1900 had been lost 100 years later (Nierenberg and Halweil 2004). The UN FAO reported in 2010 that even though modern breeding

programs are continually releasing new varieties for use in production, the observed trend is for farmers (and especially traditional farmers in developing countries) to abandon their locally adapted varieties (FAO 2010). The UN FAO estimated in 1998 that as many as two domesticated animal breeds were being lost each week worldwide (FAO 1998), and noted again in 2007 that a similar rate of loss continued as more farmers shifted to market-oriented confinement production systems, putting at least 20% of known animal breeds in danger of extinction (FAO 2007).

In the meantime, the genetic bases of most major crops and livestock species have become increasingly uniform. At the end of the last century, only six varieties of corn, for example, accounted for more than 70% of the world’s corn crop, and 99% of the turkeys raised in the United States belonged to a single breed (FAO 1998).

The loss of genetic diversity has occurred mainly because of industrial agriculture’s emphasis on short-term productivity gains. When highly productive varieties and breeds are developed, they tend to be adopted in favor of others, even when the varieties they displace have many desirable and potentially desirable traits. Genetic homogeneity among crops and livestock is also consistent with the maximization of productive efficiency because it allows standardization of management practices.

For crop plants, a major problem with increasing genetic uniformity is that it leaves each crop as a whole more vulnerable to attack by pests and pathogens that acquire resistance to pesticides and to the plants’ own defensive compounds; it also makes crops more vulnerable to changes in climate and other environmental factors. These are not insignificant or hypothetical threats. Every year, crop pests and pathogens destroy an estimated 30%–40% of potential yield. Plant pathogens can evolve rapidly to overcome crop’s defenses, and global commerce and genetically uniform farm fields allow these new virulent strains to spread rapidly from field to field and continent to continent. In a report on crop diversity and disease threats released in 2005, researchers identified four diseases with the potential to devastate the US corn crop, five that could threaten potatoes, and three with the potential to harm US-grown wheat (Qualset and Shands 2005). In late 2004, a new soybean rust (a type of fungus) appeared in the southern United States and began to attack the soybean crop. By 2009, soybean rust had spread to 16 states and more than 576 counties in the United States and at least 3 states in

Mexico. By 2012, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) had reported its appearance in Texas and Florida. None of the commercial soybean varieties planted in the United States are yet resistant to the rust fungus, and scientists are concerned about the potential impact on the multibillion US dollar soybean harvest as the rust continues to spread.

Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers—and more recently, plant scientists—have responded to outbreaks of disease by finding and planting resistant varieties of the affected crop. But as the size of each crop’s genetic reservoir declines, there are fewer and fewer varieties from which to

Case for Fundamental Change in Agriculture **13**

draw resistant or adaptive genes. The importance of having a large genetic reservoir can be illustrated by example. In 1968, greenbugs attacked the US sorghum crop, causing an estimated $100 million in damage. The next year, insecticides were used to control the greenbugs at a cost of about $50 million. Soon thereafter, however, researchers discovered a sorghum variety that carried resistance to the greenbugs. No one had known of the greenbug resistance, but it was there nonetheless. This variety was used to create a hybrid that was grown extensively and not eaten by greenbugs, making the use of pesticides unnecessary. Such pest resistance is common in domesticated plants, “hiding” in the genome but waiting to be used by plant breeders. As varieties are lost, however, the valuable genetic reservoir of traits is reduced in size, and certain traits potentially invaluable for future breeding are lost forever. There may very well be a soybean variety somewhere in the world resistant to the new soybean rust, but will plant scientists locate it before it goes extinct? A broader issue is that agricultural systems with narrowed genetic bases are less effective in integrating with and supporting the function of natural systems and thereby helping to create multifunctional landscapes (see Chapter 23).

Increasing vulnerability to disease is also a serious concern for domesticated animal species as they lose their genetic diversity, but perhaps more serious is increased dependence on methods of industrial food production. Livestock breeds that are not adapted to local conditions require climate-­ controlled environments, doses of antibiotics, and large amounts of high-protein feed.

Accompanying the concentration of agriculture into largescale monocultural systems and factory farms has been a dramatic decline in the number of farms and farmers,

5,084,000

4,500,000

3,500,000

3,000,000

2,500,000

2,175,000

especially in developed countries where mechanization and high levels of external inputs are the norm. From 1920 to the turn of the century, the number of farms in the United States dropped from more than 6.5 million to just over 2 million, and the percentage of the population that lived and worked on farms dropped below 2%. Data from the 2000 US census showed that only 0.4% of the employed civilians in the United States listed their occupation as “farmer or rancher” (US Census Bureau 2005). Although the 2007 agricultural census showed the first increase in the number of farms in more than 30 years, the increase was primarily in large- and small-scale operations. Midsize farms have continued to decline in the United States at much the same rate as seen

during the last century (Gliessman 2009).

In developing countries as well, rural people who work primarily in agriculture continue to abandon the land to move to urban and industrial areas, which will hold an estimated 60% of the world’s population by 2030, and perhaps 70% by 2050. China is now carrying out a long-term plan to move 250 _million_ rural people—most of them small-scale farmers—into newly built towns and cities. The country’s leaders hope that expanding the number of urban dwellers will greatly increase consumption and thus economic growth, but they have not directly addressed the issue of how those in the cities will be fed, or what the effects will be of leaving responsibility for food production in the hands of fewer and fewer people. As shown in Figure 1.8, there are now far more people in the world whose livelihoods are nonagricultural than there are people who grow food, and this gap continues to widen over time.

Besides encouraging an exodus from rural areas, largescale commodity-oriented farming tends to wrest control of food production from rural communities. This trend is disturbing because local control and place-based knowledge and connection are crucial to the kind of management required

Figures for 2011 and beyond are projections.

for sustainable production. Food production carried out according to the dictates of the global market, and through technologies developed elsewhere, inevitably severs the connection to ecological principles. Experience-based management skill is replaced by purchased inputs requiring more capital, energy, and use of nonrenewable resources. Farmers become mere instruments of technology application, rather than independent decision makers and managers.

Smaller-scale farmers seem to have little power against the advancement of industrial agriculture. Smaller farms cannot afford the cost of upgrading their farm equipment and technologies in order to compete successfully with the large farm operations. Moreover, the increase in the share of the food dollar going to distributors and marketers, coupled with cheap food policies that have kept farm prices relatively stable, has left many farmers in a tightening squeeze between production costs and marketing costs. As the industrial food system has expanded in the United States over the last century, increasing the physical and economic distance between farmers and consumers, US farmers’ share of the consumer food dollar has continued to shrink, and now stands below $0.16 according to the USDA (Economic Research Service 2014).

Faced with such economic uncertainty, there is less incentive for farmers to stay on the land. One trend is for larger farmers to buy out their smaller neighbors. But when agricultural land is adjacent to rapidly expanding urban centers, such as in California, the incentive instead is to sell farmland at the inflated value it has as urban land. Because of this dynamic, the agriculturally rich Great Central Valley of California has seen the loss of hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland to development since 1950, and the rate of loss of agricultural land in the state as a whole averaged 49,700 acres annually from 1988 to 1998 (Kuminoff et al. 2001). Of the 538,000 acres of agricultural land in California urbanized since the Gold Rush, one-sixth has been lost to farming in the few decades since 1990 (Thompson 2009). At present, agricultural land is lost to urbanization at the rate of more than 40,000 acres annually (American Farmland Trust 2007).

In less-developed countries, the growth of large-scale export agriculture has an even more ominous effect. Elites in these countries have, for a long time, gained control of land through various and often illegal means to increase production of export crops. More recently, however, the growing value of agricultural land in less-developed countries has attracted international investors, who have been buying it up at a rapid pace. In the decade between 2000 and 2010, more than 203 million hectares of land in less-developed countries were the object of sale or lease negotiations (Anseeuw et al. 2012). The majority of these land deals were made for the express purpose of growing export crops—biofuels in particular—and will contribute nothing to the food supplies of the countries in which they are located. In nearly all cases, realizing investors’ plans means removing the people living on and farming the land, often violently and usually without consultation or compensation (Geary 2012).

As a result of these and other trends, rural people—once able to feed themselves adequately _and_ sell surplus food to city dwellers—now make up the most food-insecure group worldwide. It is estimated that 80% of the world’s hungry live in rural areas (Mikhail 2012). And as more and more rural smallholders are pushed off the land, they migrate to cities, where they become dependent on others for their food. Since more of the food produced in the countryside is destined for export, increasing amounts of food for the expanding urban areas must be imported. In 2009, 111 developing countries in the world, most of them with low average incomes, were classified as “net food importers” (Valdéz and Foster 2012). This imbalance threatens the food security of less-developed countries and makes their people extremely vulnerable to spikes in the prices of globally traded food staples.

The size, scale, integration, and technological sophistication of the world food system tends to give the impression that it can easily resist the environmental vagaries—droughts, floods, cold snaps, pest infestations—that have plagued farmers since humans took up agriculture thousands of years ago. But this impression is a false one: industrial agriculture has actually made itself extraordinarily vulnerable to extreme weather events, climatic shifts, and pests and diseases (Figure 1.9).

A central cause of this vulnerability is the practice of monoculture, especially when it is combined with its usual concomitant of increasing the genetic uniformity of the crop. Planting the same variety of a single crop across a wide geographic area virtually assures that when nature serves up conditions hostile to that crop’s development—a late spring frost, a severe drought, an extreme weather event— the damage will be widespread. When the damage is caused by drought, the effects are intensified by the dependence on

**FIGURE 1.9** **A dried-up, drought-affected soybean field in** **northern Iowa.** The extreme drought of 2012, one of the most severe on record, caused significant crop losses in the Midwest of the United States. (Photo courtesy of Laura Jackson.)

Case for Fundamental Change in Agriculture **15**

synthetic fertilizer, because years of providing crop nutrition solely through chemical means have dramatically lowered the soil’s moisture-holding capacity through depletion of its organic matter. As noted earlier, monoculture and genetic uniformity also dramatically increase vulnerability to pests and disease. A virtual sea of host organisms, all with their natural resistance bred out of them, is the perfect opportunity for a fungus, virus, or insect to vastly improve its reproductive success in a very short time span. Further exacerbating the problem is the inherent risk of depending on only three crops—corn, rice, and wheat—for more than half of the world’s food.

Climate change assures that industrial agriculture’s vulnerability (or, put the other way, its lack of resilience) will increasingly become a matter of serious concern. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and severity of droughts and floods, to increase the incidence of extreme cold and heat, to reduce the mountain snowfall on which many regions rely for irrigation water, and to allow pests and diseases to move to regions where they were formerly excluded by winter cold. An earth beset by a changing climate needs exceptionally resilient agroecosystems, not the opposite.

Because of its interconnected nature, the world food system is also vulnerable to social, political, and economic factors that have no direct connection to climate, weather, or the environment. Increases in the price of oil, trade agreements, unilateral governmental actions, and disruptions in the world economy are among the many factors that may have important effects on food prices and food supplies. In this realm, however, it is necessary to clarify who bears the brunt of the “vulnerability.” Industrial agriculture has become so deeply integrated into the world economic system, which is controlled by a relative handful of elites, that it is not industrial agriculture itself that is vulnerable so much as it is the world’s food consumers and smallholder farmers. The world’s food

staples, like corn, soybeans, wheat, and rice, are increasingly treated as commodities for wealth production, not as food. Long bought and sold in the international commodity markets, they are now subject to speculation, just like home mortgages, currency, and gold. Such speculation now drives food prices more strongly than any other single factor (HoltGimenez and Patel 2009).

**G** **lobal** **I** **nequality**

Despite increases in productivity and yields, hunger persists all over the globe. More than 1 billion people around the world are chronically hungry and more than 870 million are chronically undernourished (CGIAR 2013). With increasing frequency, events such as the spike in global food prices that occurred in 2008 and the major droughts of 2005, 2010, and 2012 create even more hungry people (Bailey 2011). There are also huge disparities in calorie intake and food security between people in developed nations and those in developing nations. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the world reached a dubious milestone: the number of overweight people (about 1.1 billion) grew roughly equal

to the number of underweight people (Gardner and Halweil 2000). This statistic indicates that the unequal distribution of food—which is both a cause and a consequence of global ­inequality—is at least as serious a problem as the threats to global food production.

Since hunger, poverty, and inequality existed before the rise of industrial agriculture in the latter half of the 1900s, it is tempting to argue that global inequality is unrelated to industrial agriculture—that it has separate causes. While some causes are indeed separate, it is also true that industrial agriculture perpetuates and accentuates existing relationships of inequality. It does this because it is designed to generate profits for the owners of agribusiness concerns and because this process of wealth generation depends on increasing its control of land, farmers, resources, markets, and distribution

networks. The inevitable result is the enrichment of some

groups and some countries at the expense of others.

Developing nations too often grow food mainly for export to developed nations, using external inputs purchased from the developed nations. While the profits from the sale of the export crops enrich small numbers of elite landowners, many people in the developing nations go hungry. In addition, those with any land are often displaced as the privileged seek more land on which to grow export crops.

Besides causing unnecessary human suffering, relationships of inequality tend to promote agricultural policies and farmer practices that are driven more by economic considerations than by ecological wisdom and long-term thinking. For example, subsistence farmers in developing nations, displaced by large landowners increasing production for export, are often forced to farm marginal lands. The results are deforestation, severe erosion, and serious social and ecological harm. As long as industrial agriculture is based on technology originating in the developed world and on external inputs accessible to so few, the practice of agriculture will perpetuate inequality, and inequality will remain a barrier to sustainability.

**PATH TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY**

What is the alternative to industrial agriculture? Despite being dedicated to developing forms of sustainable agriculture, the field of agroecology cannot answer this question as directly as the reader might wish. Agroecology consists of principles, concepts, and strategies that must form the foundation of any system of food production that can make a legitimate claim to being a more sustainable successor to industrial agriculture. These principles, concepts, and strategies are more oriented toward offering a design framework for sustainable agroecosystems than they are prescriptions or blueprints for the construction or management of actual agroecosystems, and they do not dictate the specifics of an entire world food system.

Nonetheless, agroecological principles do suggest the general elements of a sustainable food system, and describing these elements will help the reader visualize some of the goals toward which the agroecological approach points.

Before describing the elements of a future food system that operates on a more sustainable basis than the industrial agriculture-based system of today, it is helpful to explore what is meant by the term _sustainability_ .

As scientists, analysts, activists, and others point with increasing frequency to the _un_ sustainability of human society’s current systems and practices—everything from fossilfuel use and industrial agriculture to an economic system dependent on constant growth—it has become ever more common to adopt the label “sustainable.” Everyone wants his or her product, industry, alternative method, or proposal to be considered “sustainable.” As a result, the term _sus-_ _tainability_ has become increasingly vague, ambiguous, and confusing.

In addition, as a framework for critical analysis of industrial agriculture and for development of alternatives, the concept of sustainability has a key weakness because it depends entirely on an inferred or hypothesized future. Condemning a practice or system as _un_ sustainable is essentially to claim that it is bad because it will not last. This sidesteps the possibility that it is causing serious negative consequences right now, in the present. Conversely, arguing for the desirability of a system or practice because it is “sustainable” is really to say that its major benefit would be its durability over time—that we could expect it to still exist at some time in the future. This by itself does not ensure that the system or practice mitigates or reverses harms to people or natural systems. And underlying these drawbacks is a very real practical problem with the concept of sustainability: because sustainability _per se_ can never be demonstrated in the present, its proof always remains in the future, out of reach. Thus it is almost impossible to know for sure if a particular practice is in fact sustainable or if a particular set of practices constitutes sustainability.

Despite the drawbacks of the term _sustainability_, however, this text has not abandoned it in favor of another term. In part, that is because there is no good alternative term. Moreover, used precisely and in accordance with its original meaning, _sustainability_ really does convey the essence of what we hope to create as an alternative to industrial agriculture—a system of food production, distribution, and consumption that will endure indefinitely because it does not sow the seeds of its own demise. But there is much more

to sustainability than mere endurance. As used in this text, _sustainability_ refers also to the many characteristics of an ostensibly sustainable practice or system that are responsible for endowing that practice or system with the selfsufficiency, resilience, and balance that _allow it_ to endure over time.

If we are going to use the term _sustainable_ to indicate the essential feature of what we hope to create as an alternative to industrial agriculture, we should be quite precise about what is entailed in our use of the term. Based on our present knowledge, we can suggest that a “sustainable” food system would, at the very least,

- Have minimal negative effects on the environ ment and release insignificant amounts of toxic or damaging substances into the atmosphere, surface water, or groundwater;

- Minimize the production of greenhouse gases, work

to mitigate climate change by increasing the ability of managed systems to store fixed carbon, and facilitate human adaptation to a warming climate;

- Preserve and rebuild soil fertility, prevent soil ero sion, and maintain the soil’s ecological health;

- Use water in a way that allows aquifers to be

recharged and the water needs of the environment and people to be met;

- Rely mainly on resources within the agroecosystem,

including nearby communities, by replacing external inputs with nutrient cycling, better conservation, and an expanded base of ecological knowledge;

- Work to value and conserve biological diversity,

both in the wild and in domesticated landscapes;

- Guarantee equality of access to appropriate agri cultural practices, knowledge, and technologies and enable local control of agricultural resources;

- Eliminate hunger, ensure food security in culturally

appropriate ways, and guarantee every human being a right to adequate food;

- Remove social, economic, and political injustices

from food systems.

Each of these features of a sustainable system can be demonstrated in the present, and each one involves undeniable benefits to people and the ecological and social systems on which people depend.

Using this list of characteristics of sustainability as a guide, we can envision what food systems of the future might look like—if humankind as a whole begins to follow “the path toward sustainability.” Many elements of these systems are already beginning to appear in rough form, alongside industrial food systems, as agroecology grows and spreads.

- The sustainable food system of the future will be

made up, in large part, of innumerable small- to medium-scale agroecosystems, each relatively selfcontained, adapted to local conditions, and focused primarily on satisfying the food needs of a local population. Only after they satisfy local needs will these agroecosystems attend to the needs of more distant communities.

- Food networks will replace food chains as all play ers in the food system (from the farm to the table) are reconnected and have a say in what is produced, how it is produced, and how it is exchanged and distributed.

Case for Fundamental Change in Agriculture **17**

It is not an exaggeration to say that the sustainable food system of the future, considered as a whole, will represent a paradigm shift. Like traditional and indigenous agroecosystems, it will conserve resources and minimize exogenous inputs. Like industrial agriculture, it will be very productive. And unlike any system of food production that has heretofore existed on the planet, it will combine these attributes while distributing its benefits equitably among human beings and societies and refraining from displacing its costs onto natural ecosystems increasingly pushed to the brink of collapse. In order for this paradigm shift to come about, agroecology must become a force for change that integrates research, practice, and social change in all parts of our food systems.

industrial-based systems, still provide more than two-thirds of the world’s food. Already embodying many of the key attributes of sustainability, these systems will remain a fundamental basis of food production for much of the world, as their productivity and efficiency are improved through agroecological research.

- Cities—which will continue to provide homes for

a large number of the world’s people—will be supplied with food less by global markets and more by agroecosystems in the surrounding region and in the cities themselves.

- Agricultural knowledge will exist primarily in the

public domain, where it will be widely dispersed and embodied more in farmers’ practices than in technological products and systems.

- Farmers will be rewarded for the environmental

services that their farms provide beyond the production of food. Protecting biodiversity, producing clean water, stopping soil erosion, sequestering carbon, and promoting the presence of living landscapes will be valued and rewarded.

- Because sustainability in agriculture is not just

about growing and raising food, but about how that food is used, distributed, and consumed, a sustainable food system will distribute food more equitably, reduce food overconsumption and waste, and insure that our precious agricultural land is used to feed people rather than automobiles and livestock.

- Food justice will be a common goal in sustainable

food systems as food security, food sovereignty, and the right to food become guiding social principles.

Advocates for industrial agriculture argue that the only way to satisfy the food needs of the expanding world population is to continue to develop new agricultural technologies—­ particularly GM crop varieties—that will increase yields, reduce insect damage, and eliminate competition from weeds. They dismiss alternative, sustainable, and ecologically based systems as inadequate to the task of growing the needed amount of food. This view is mistaken on at least two accounts.

First, this view exaggerates the need for increasing yields. Globally, the food system currently produces more than enough food calories to adequately feed every single living human being and more (Cassidy et al. 2013). One problem is that 9% of these calories are diverted to make biofuels or other

industrial products and another 36% are used for animal feed (less than 10% of which is recovered in the form of animalbased food calories), leaving only 55% to be eaten directly by humans. Another problem is that an estimated _one-third_ of the food produced globally is lost to spoilage, spillage, and other problems along the supply chain or simply wasted at the household level (FAO 2013a). In the United States, the amount of food wasted and lost equates to 1249 cal/person/day, which is more than half of what an average person needs (Buzby et al. 2014). Further, the calories that are eaten by humans directly and not lost as waste are distributed very unevenly, with much of them going to expand the waistlines of affluent populations. Thus, the need for more food is driven not as much by the increase in population as it is by wasteful patterns of food use and a shift toward richer diets— _both of which are social_ _choices_ . If people ate less animal-based food on average and food was used and distributed more equitably and efficiently, as noted in the previous section, more than enough extra food production capacity would be freed up to feed everyone adequately, leaving a buffer for feeding an expanding population.

Second, this view ignores a growing body of research showing that small-scale, ecologically based, organic, and even traditional peasant systems can approach, match, and even exceed the productivity of industrial systems when measured by the number of people fed per unit of land or the food biomass produced per unit area. These agroecosystems are usually the kinds of diverse, multilayered and integrated systems

**18** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

First, we require more and better knowledge of the ecological relationships among domesticated agricultural species, among these species and the physical environment, and among these species and those of natural systems. This need is satisfied by the **science aspect of agroecology**, which draws on modern ecological knowledge and methods to derive the principles that can be used to design and manage sustainable agroecosystems.

**FIGURE 1.11** **High diversity of production is possible even in** **the winter on an alternative farm.** This farmers’ market stand is a direct market option for a 40-acre certified organic family farm located in Santa Cruz County, CA. They grow over 45 varieties of fruits and vegetables, including dry farm tomatoes, shelling beans, and strawberries, and sell their produce to customers and restaurants at 10 farmers’ markets in Santa Cruz, Berkeley, and San Francisco.

that will be discussed in Sections IV and V of this text, with a focus on meeting local needs, providing food for the larger communities in which they participate, and maintaining the productive capacity of the soil for the long term. The emphasis of these systems is definitely not on monoculture yield maximization nor the market. A comprehensive 2011 report, presented before the UN Human Rights Council and based on an extensive review of recent scientific literature, showed that agroecologically guided restructuring of agroecosystems has the capability of doubling food production in entire regions within 10 years, while mitigating climate change and alleviating rural poverty (De Schutter 2011).

**R** **ole** **of** **A** **groecology**

Many scientists, researchers, and educators in the field of agroecology, and their colleagues in disciplines like agronomy, have long believed that their role is to come up with agricultural methods and systems that are more sustainable, more environmentally friendly, less input dependent, and less technology intensive than those of industrial agriculture. The assumption is that these methods and systems will then be adopted because they are superior when judged by any of various sets of criteria. Unfortunately, the experience of the last couple of decades has exposed the limitations of this view. Although we have accumulated a great deal of knowledge about the ecological relationships underlying sustainable food production, that knowledge has seen relatively little application, and industrial agriculture has meanwhile strengthened its dominance of the world food system.

Transforming agriculture in a fundamental way—putting it on a sustainable path—is going to be a tremendous challenge. A basic assumption of this textbook is that agroecologists can hope to meet this challenge only if we approach it on three different fronts simultaneously.

Second, we require effective and innovative agricultural practices, on-the-ground systems that work in the present to satisfy our food needs while laying the groundwork for the more sustainable systems of the future. Satisfying this need is the **practical aspect of agroecology**, which values the local, empirical knowledge of farmers and the sharing of this knowledge, and which undercuts the distinction between the production of knowledge and its application.

Finally, circumstances demand fundamental changes in the ways that humans relate to food, the economic and social systems that determine the distribution of food, and the ways in which food mediates the relationships of power among populations, classes, and countries. Serving this need is the **social-change aspect of agroecology**, which not only advocates for the changes that will lead to food security for all, but also seeks knowledge of the means by which these changes can be activated and sustained.

Although each of these aspects of agroecology is critical, the bulk of this book is dedicated to the science of agroecology. In presenting this material, the book highlights the practical aspect by giving examples of how the science can be successfully applied. The social-change aspect of agroecology is not introduced until Section VI, after the reader has absorbed the full suite of ecological principles and practices that form the foundation of sustainable food systems. The placement of this aspect of agroecology at the end of the book is not an indication of its secondary importance. If agroecologists and others seeking to put agriculture on a more sustainable basis fail to consider the ideas discussed in Section VI, their efforts are likely to be for naught.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. How does the holistic approach of agroecology

allow for the integration of the three most important components of sustainability: ecological soundness, economic viability, and social justice? 2. Why has it been so difficult for humans to see that

much of the environmental degradation caused by industrial agriculture is a consequence of the lack of an ecological approach to agriculture? 3. What common ground is there between agronomy

and ecology with respect to sustainable agriculture? 4. What are the issues of greatest importance that

threaten the sustainability of agriculture in the town or region in which you live? 5. What is the meaning of the concept that people

“have a right to food”?
