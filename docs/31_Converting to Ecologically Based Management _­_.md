## chapter 22. _­_ Converting to Ecologically Based Management _­_

Farmers have a reputation for being innovators and experimenters, willingly adopting new practices when they perceive that some benefit will be gained. Over the past 50–60 years, innovation in agriculture has been driven mainly by an emphasis on high yields and farm profit, resulting in not only remarkable returns but also an array of negative environmental and social side effects. Despite the continuation of strong pressure to focus on the bottom line, however, many farmers are choosing to make the transition to practices that are more environmentally sound and have the potential for contributing to long-term sustainability for agriculture. Others are starting agricultural enterprises from scratch that incorporate a variety of ecologically informed approaches. Both types of efforts represent “conversion” in the broad sense.

The remarkable growth of organic, alternative, and ecological agriculture in developed countries during the past several decades indicates that a transformation in the way we grow food is already underway. Between 1997 and 2013, the number of acres of organic cropland in the United States more than quadrupled, reaching 2.3 million. During this time, consumer demand for organic products has risen between 10% and 20% annually (USDA 2013). The total value of production from certified cropland is estimated at more than $32 million for 2013, with the value of production from certified organic pasture and rangeland having reached about $24 million per year. Clearly, a more sustainable approach to growing food, one that challenges conventional agricultural wisdom, is gaining ground both culturally and economically.

The conversion to ecologically based management is _­_ grounded in the principles discussed in the preceding chapters. In this chapter, we discuss how those principles can come into play in the actual process of changing the way food is grown. Farmers engaged in the conversion process know, through intuition, experience, and knowledge, what is _un_ sustainable and what is, at the very least, _more_ sustainable. Nevertheless, there is a clear need to study the process in more detail. This chapter makes a contribution toward that goal by proposing a protocol for converting industrial/conventional systems into more sustainable systems. Determining what constitutes sustainability itself is the topic of Chapter 23.

**FACTORS PROMOTING CONVERSION**

Agriculture is always evolving and adopting new practices. In the twentieth century, agriculture responded to a

complex of economic and technological pressures that led to the development of the highly specialized and purchasedinput-dependent systems that dominate agriculture today. Yield-increasing technologies, farm support programs, and research developments helped push agriculture toward fewer larger farms. But some years ago, many farmers began to transition into what today we call “alternative agriculture” (National Research Council 1989; Gliessman and Rosemeyer 2010). The adoption of alternative practices has since accelerated, with several factors encouraging farmers to question industrial and conventional practices and manage agroecosystems in more sustainable ways:

- The cost of energy has risen dramatically and con tinues to rise.

- Crops produced with industrial or conventional

practices have low profit margins.

- New ecological practices with demonstrated poten tial for success have been and are being developed.

- Environmental awareness and food quality con sciousness among consumers, producers, and regulators are increasing.

- There are new and stronger markets for alternatively

grown and processed farm products.

- Farmers sense increasing cultural support for the

adoption of ecological-based methods and recognize that consumers and community members across the political spectrum can support the values of conservation, self-sufficiency, autonomy, and responsibility that underlie alternative agriculture.

- There are increasing numbers of “role models”— _­_

farmers who have successfully converted to sustainable/ecological methods.

Despite the fact that farmers often suffer a reduction in both yield and profit in the first or second year of the transition period, most of those who persist eventually realize both economic and ecological benefits from having made the conversion. Much of the success of the transition depends on a farmer’s ability to adjust the economics of the farm operation to a new set of input and management costs and different market systems and prices.

**GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR CONVERSION**

The conversion process can be complex, requiring changes in field practices, day-to-day management of the farming operation, planning, marketing, and philosophy. The following

**277**

**278** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

leads to the development of the properties of sustainable agroecosystems that will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter. Emphasis on particular principles will vary, but all of them can contribute greatly to the conversion process. We should not be satisfied with an approach to conversion that only replaces industrial/conventional inputs and practices with environmentally benign alternatives; nor should we be satisfied with an approach dictated solely by market demands, or one that doesn’t take into account the economic and social health of agricultural communities. Conversion must be part of ensuring long-term food security for everyone in all parts of the world.

**LEVELS OF CONVERSION**

**FIGURE 22.1** **The experimental farm at the CASFS, UC Santa** **Cruz, CA.** Innovative research on the design and management of sustainable agroecosystems is carried out at this unique facility.

principles can serve as general guidelines for navigating the overall transformation:

- Shift from through-flow nutrient management to

a nutrient recycling model, with increased dependence on natural processes such as biological nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizal relationships.

- Use renewable sources of energy instead of nonre newable sources.

- Eliminate the use of nonrenewable off-farm human

inputs that have the potential to harm the environment or the health of farmers, farmworkers, or consumers.

- When materials must be added to the system, use

naturally occurring materials instead of synthetic, manufactured inputs.

- Manage pests, diseases, and weeds instead of “con trolling” them.

- Reestablish the biological relationships that can

occur naturally on the farm instead of reducing and simplifying them.

- Make more appropriate matches between cropping

patterns and the productive potential and physical limitations of the farm landscape.

- Use a strategy of adapting the biological and genetic

potential of agricultural plant and animal species to the ecological conditions of the farm rather than modifying the farm to meet the needs of the crops and animals.

- Value most highly the overall health of the agroeco system rather than the outcome of a particular crop

system or season.

- Emphasize conservation of soil, water, energy, and

biological resources.

- Incorporate the idea of long-term sustainability into

overall agroecosystem design and management.

The integration of these principles creates a synergism of interactions and relationships on the farm that eventually

For many farmers, rapid conversion to sustainable agroecosystem design and practice is neither possible nor practical. As a result, many conversion efforts proceed in slower steps toward the ultimate goal of sustainability, or are simply focused on developing food production systems that are somewhat more environmentally sound. From the observed range of conversion efforts, three distinct levels of conversion at the farm scale have been discerned (MacRae et al. 1990; Gliessman 2004). Two additional levels that go beyond the farm scale are proposed here. The first three levels help us describe the steps that farmers actually take in converting from industrial or conventional agroecosystems, and all five levels taken together can serve as a map outlining a stepwise, evolutionary conversion process for the entire global food system

**Level 1:** Increase the efficiency of industrial/ conventional practices in order to reduce the use and consumption of costly, scarce, or environmentally damaging inputs.

The goal of this approach is to use inputs more efficiently so that fewer inputs will be needed and the negative impacts of their use will be reduced as well. This approach has been the primary emphasis of much conventional agricultural research, through which numerous agricultural technologies and practices have been developed. Examples include optimal crop spacing and density, improved machinery, pest monitoring for improved pesticide application, improved timing of operations, and precision farming for optimal fertilizer and water placement. Although these kinds of efforts reduce the negative impacts of conventional agriculture, they do not help break its dependence on external human inputs. **Level 2:** Substitute alternative practices for industrial/ conventional inputs and practices.

The goal at this level of conversion is to replace resource-intensive and environment-degrading products and practices with those that are more environmentally benign. Organic farming and biological agriculture research have emphasized such an approach (Figure 22.2). Examples of alternative practices include the use of nitrogen-fixing

Converting to Ecologically Based Management **279**

through the use of rotations, multiple cropping, and agroforestry. **Level 4:** Reestablish a more direct connection between

those who grow the food and those who consume it.

**FIGURE 22.2** **An on-farm study of a Level 2 conversion** **process with strawberries on the central coast of California.** Conventional and organic practices are simultaneously compared for at least 3 years.

covercrops and rotations to replace synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, the use of biological control agents rather than pesticides, and the shift to reduced or minimal tillage. At this level, the basic agroecosystem structure is not greatly altered, hence many of the same problems that occur in industrial and conventional systems also occur in those with input substitution.

**Level 3:** Redesign the agroecosystem so that it functions on the basis of a new set of ecological processes.

At this level, fundamental changes in overall system design eliminate the root causes of many of the problems that still exist at Levels 1 and 2. Thus rather than finding sounder ways of solving problems, the problems are prevented from arising in the first place. Whole-system conversion studies allow for an understanding of yield-limiting factors in the context of agroecosystem structure and function. Problems are recognized, and thereby prevented, by internal site- and time-specific design and management approaches, instead of by the application of external inputs. An example is the diversification of farm structure and management

Conversion occurs within a cultural and economic

context, and that context must support conversion to more sustainable practices. At a local level, this means consumers value locally grown food and support with their food dollars the farmers who are striving to move through conversion Levels 1–3. This support turns into a kind of “food citizenship” (see Chapter 25) and becomes a force for food-system change. The more this transformation occurs in communities

around the world, the closer we move toward building the new culture and economy of sustainability that is the prerequisite for reaching Level 5. **Level 5:** On the foundation created by the sustainable farm-scale agroecosystems of Level 3 and the sustainable food relationships of Level 4, build a new global food system, based on equity, participation, and justice, that is not only sustainable but also helps restore and protect earth’s life-support systems.

Unlike Levels 1–4, Level 5 entails change that is global in scope and reaches so deeply into the nature of human civilization that it transcends the concept of “conversion.” Nevertheless, the path to Level 5 necessarily passes through the farm-scale, down-toearth conversion process that we are focusing on in this chapter and the next. We will explore what transitioning to Level 5 might involve in the final section of this text.

In terms of research, agronomists and other agricultural researchers have done a good job of working on the transition from Level 1 to Level 2, and research on the transition to Level 3 has been underway for some time. Work on the ethics and economics of food-system sustainability that are involved in Levels 4 and 5, however, has only just begun (Freyfogle 2001; Berry 2009; Jackson 2011). Agroecology provides the basis for the type of research that is needed. And eventually it will help us find answers to larger, more abstract questions, such as what sustainability is and how we will know we have achieved it.

**CASE STUDY: CONVERSION OF A STRAWBERRY PRODUCTION SYSTEM**

The central coast of California, with its Mediterranean climate, is an important strawberry-growing region. On approximately 15,366 acres, Monterey and Santa Cruz counties together produced more than $976 million worth of strawberries in 2012, about half of the total California crop. Strawberry production here, as in many other locales, is highly dependent on expensive, energy-intensive, and environmentally harmful off-farm inputs.

For almost 30 years, the Agroecology Research Group at the University of California (UC), Santa Cruz, CA has been carrying out a multifaceted research project centered on studying the process of converting these industrial/conventional strawberry production systems into more sustainable agroecosystems. This project provides evidence that even systems strongly invested in industrial/conventional practices can be changed; it also exemplifies the difficulties and barriers inherent in conversion. The year-by-year evolution of the strawberry conversion research project is outlined in Table 22.1.

The present system of industrial/conventional strawberry production in California can be traced back to the early 1960s, when the soil fumigant methyl bromide (MeBr) was introduced. Until that time, growers treated strawberries as a perennial crop, with each field requiring rotation out of strawberries for several years. Use of methyl bromide allowed growers to manage strawberries as an annual crop, planted year after year on the same piece of land. In the system used since the 1960s, strawberry plants are removed each year following the end of the season in late summer or early fall, and then the soil is cultivated and fumigated before being replanted with new plants for the next season. Intensive systems of drip irrigation, plastic mulch, and soil manipulation are required (Figure 22.3).

**Level 1 Conversion**

The first efforts related to conversion, carried out before the involvement of the Agroecology Research Group, were focused as much on increasing yields and profitability as on changing the nature of the production system. Extensive research was carried out to discover more effective ways of controlling pests and diseases so that inputs could be reduced and their environmental impacts lessened. For example, different miticides for control of the common pest two-spotted spider mite ( _Tetranychus urticae_ ) were tested with the goal of overcoming the problems of evolving mite resistance to the pesticides, negative impacts on nontarget organisms, pollution of groundwater, persistent residues on harvested berries, and health impacts for farmworkers (Sances 1982).

**Level 2 Conversion**

In the early 1980s, as interest in organic food became a potential market force in agriculture and issues of pesticide safety and environmental quality came to the fore, farmers began to respond. It was in this environment that researchers at UC Santa Cruz and a local farmer formed a partnership for conversion. In 1987, this partnership became a comparative

Converting to Ecologically Based Management **281**

Conversion to organic management involves replacing this very toxic and expensive chemical with a variety of alternative inputs and practices.

strawberry conversion research project. For 3 years, strawberries were grown in plots using conventional inputs and management side by side with strawberries grown under organic management. In the organic plots, each conventional input or practice was substituted with an organic equivalent. For example, rather than control the two-spotted spider mite with a miticide, beneficial predator mites ( _Phytoseiulus persimilis_ ) were released into the organic plots. Over the 3-year conversion period population levels of the two-spotted spider mite were monitored, releases of the predator carried out, and responses quantified. By the end of the third year of the study, ideal rates and release amounts for the predator—now the norm for the industry—had been worked out (Gliessman et al. 1996).

After the 3-year comparison study, researchers continued to observe changes and the farmer continued to make adjustments in his input use and practices. This was especially true in regard to soilborne diseases. After a few years of organic management, diseases such as _Verticillium dahliae_, a source of root rot, began to occur with greater frequency. The response was to intensify research on input substitution. Initial experiments with mustard biofumigation took place, adjustments in organic fertility management occurred, and mycorrhizal soil inoculants were tested. But the agroecosystem was still basically a monoculture of strawberries, and problems with disease increased.

Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) is a way of substituting for MeBr fumigation. With this technique, different sources of organic matter, from broccoli crop residue to mustard seed cake, are incorporated into the soil, which is then flooded with water and covered with an impermeable plastic tarp. The combination of anaerobic conditions and the release of the breakdown products of the organic matter fulfill the same function as MeBr, but the materials are accepted by organic certification standards (Shennan et al. 2010). The big question is if this substitution will continue to allow monoculture organic strawberries to be produced, or if it will be necessary to develop creative ways to combine the practice with diversification at Level 3.

**Level 3 Conversion**

Based on the concept that ecosystem stability comes about through the dynamic interaction of all the component parts of the system, the researchers and farmer conceived of ways to design resistance to the problems created by the simplified monoculture. The farmer realized he needed to partially return to the traditional practice of crop rotations that had been used before the appearance of MeBr. The researchers used their knowledge of ecological interactions to redesign the strawberry agroecosystem so that diversity and complexity could help make the rotations more effective, and in some cases, shorter. Testing of these ideas is making considerable progress. For example, mustard covercrops were tested for their ability to allelopathically reduce weeds and diseases through the release of toxic natural compounds. Broccoli has been shown to be very important as a rotation crop since it is not a host for the _Verticillium_ disease organism, and broccoli

residues incorporated into the soil release biofumigants that reduce the presence of disease organisms (Muramoto et al. 2005, 2014). Other crops that are not hosts for the disease, such as spinach, peas, and artichokes, have also been successfully used in rotation with strawberries.

Rather than rely on biopesticides, which still have to be purchased outside the system and released, the researchers and farmer have undertaken redesign approaches intended to incorporate natural control agents into the system, keeping them present and active on a continuous basis. For example, they tested the idea that refugia for the _P. persimilis_ predator mite could be provided, either on remnant strawberry plants or trap crop rows around the fields. Perhaps the most novel redesign idea is the introduction of rows of alfalfa into the strawberry fields as trap crops for the western tarnished plant bug ( _Lygus hesperus_ ). The pest can cause serious deformation of the strawberry fruit, and because it is a generalist pest, it is very difficult to control through input substitution. By replacing every 25th row in a strawberry field with a row of alfalfa (approximately 3% of the field), and then concentrating control strategies on that row (vacuuming, biopesticide application), it was possible to reduce _Lygus_ damage to acceptable levels (Swezey et al. 2013). The ability of these alfalfa rows to also function as reservoirs of beneficial insects for better natural pest control has been tested as well, with field sampling showing an abundance of natural enemies occurring in the alfalfa strips. A selective endoparasitoid ( _Peristenus_ _relictus_ ) from Spain has been successfully introduced into the strips, where it now breeds and helps in biological control by parasitizing nymphs of the western tarnished plant bug (Sweezy et al. 2014) (Figure 22.4).

**Level 4 Conversion**

Consumers have become a very important force in the conversion of agroecosystems to more sustainable design and management. The fourth level of conversion made its debut when students at UC Santa Cruz campus convinced the campus dining service managers to begin integrating local, organic, and fair-trade items—including organic strawberries— into the meal service. There are other indicators that a culture of sustainability is beginning to take shape. Consumers are increasing the demand for organic produce, allowing organic farming to become increasingly important. In the two central coast counties, where so many strawberries are grown, there were a total of 35,630 organic-certified acres in 2012, more than 7 times the organic acreage recorded in 1997. The total farm gate revenue from organic farming in these counties was $247.7 million in 2012, representing a dramatic increase of more than 2000% from 1997 (Monterey County Agricultural Commissioner 2013; Santa Cruz County Agricultural Commissioner 2013). A parallel increase in organic strawberry production occurred over this same time period, as can be seen in Table 22.2.

**Level 5 Conversion**

Despite these positive trends, several sustainability issues are connected with this dramatic growth in strawberry production that can be resolved only at Level 5 of the conversion process. For example, soil erosion and nutrient leaching have

been observed in organic strawberries planted over a large area. What might be called _“Level 5 thinking”_ should include consideration of such issues, as part of a concern for the health of the entire system. More complex social issues are also the focus of some initial efforts to begin the conversion to Level 5. As can be seen in Table 22.2, the number of organic strawberry producers has declined since 2000, even as the acreage planted has increased. In addition, since organic strawberries usually require more labor, issues of worker health, safety, and pay equity must be also considered. The farmer partner with the Agroecology Research Group is one of the only organic strawberry growers who years ago was willing to sign a contract with the United Farm Workers (UFW) union, guaranteeing wage, health, and vacation benefits. His is also one of the first farms to achieve what is called Food Justice Certification (www.agriculturaljusticeproject.org) because of the ways he has integrated social justice into his farming practices and his relationships with his workers. His whole-system approach to farming is an important example of steps that can be taken to make the conversion to Level 5. The next important step needed is for researchers to move beyond Levels 2 and 3 and link their work to the transformative changes needed at Levels 4 and 5.

**EVALUATING THE CONVERSION EFFORT**

Initially, the conversion to ecologically based agroecosystem management results in an array of ecological changes in the system (Gliessman 2004; Gliessman and Rosemeyer 2010). As the use of synthetic agrochemicals is reduced or eliminated, and nutrients and biomass are recycled within the system, agroecosystem structure and function change as well. A range of processes and relationships are transformed, beginning with aspects of basic soil structure, organic matter content, and diversity and activity of soil biota. Eventually major changes also occur in the activity of and relationships among weed, insect, and disease populations and in the balance between beneficial and pest organisms. Ultimately, nutrient dynamics and cycling, energy use efficiency, and overall system productivity are impacted. Measuring and

monitoring these changes during the conversion period help the farmer evaluate the success of the conversion process and respond with adaptive management. This kind of evaluation also provides a framework for determining the requirements for sustainability and helps convince a larger segment of the agricultural community that conversion to more sustainable practices is possible and economically feasible.

For a researcher, the study of the process of conversion begins with identifying a study site. This should be a functioning, on-farm, commercial crop production unit whose owner–operator wishes to convert to a recognized alternative type of management, such as certified organic agriculture, and wants to participate in the design and management of the farm system during the conversion process (Gliessman 2002b, 2004). Such a “farmer-first” approach is

**CASE STUDY: CONVERSION TO ORGANIC APPLE PRODUCTION**

Although organically managed agroecosystems may not be completely sustainable, they emphasize more sustainable practices than do industrial-style and conventional systems. Farmers considering converting to organic production, however, are concerned with more than just the ecological merits of certified organic agriculture. They want to know about the economic consequences of conversion—if they can support their families on the profits from an organic farming operation.

In recognition of such practical concerns, researchers study the conversion process and compare the economic viability of industrial/conventional and organic management. In one such study, a team of researchers from the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) at UC Santa Cruz, CA analyzed the transition from Level 1 conventional to Level 2 organic management of Granny Smith apples at a farm in Watsonville, CA (Swezey et al. 1994). The team monitored the ecological parameters of the transition, including nutrient content of the plants, weed species and abundance, pest damage, and the life cycle of the codling moth, the apple’s primary pest. This careful monitoring allowed the team to adjust their management strategies as needed. These strategies included applying organic soil amendments and disrupting the mating cycle of the codling moth through the use of pheromone dispensers that confuse the moths.

The team also tracked economic costs and income over the study period. The organic system used 10% more labor than the conventional system, due to practices such as hand thinning of the apple fruit while immature, and the cost of materials was 17% higher than in the conventional system. However, the organic system produced a higher yield in terms of apple quantity and total apple mass. Overall, the organic system also yielded a higher economic return, due both to the higher harvest yield and to the higher price obtained on the market for premium organic apples.

This study demonstrates the organic production of apples can be profitable, even though the transition from industrial/ conventional to certified organic takes careful planning and can be labor intensive. Similar studies have refined Level 2 conversion methods, leading to the publication of the first Organic Apple Production Manual for California (Swezey et al. 2002). The only Level 3 components of conversion mentioned in the manual are the use of permanent between-row legume and grass covercrops. The long-term sustainability of organic apple agroecosystems still needs to be addressed (Figure 22.5).

**FIGURE 22.5** **Fuji apples on semidwarf rootstock under conversion to organic management, Corralitos, CA.**

considered essential in the search for viable farming practices that eventually have the best chance of being adopted by other farmers.

The amount of time needed to complete the conversion process depends greatly on the type of crop or crops being

farmed, the local ecological conditions where the farm is located, and the prior history of management and input use. For short-term annual crops, the time frame might be as short as 3 years, and for perennial crops and animal systems, the time period is probably at least 5 years or longer.

Converting to Ecologically Based Management **285**

The study of the conversion process involves several levels of data collection and analysis:

1. Examine the changes in ecological factors and pro cesses over time through monitoring and sampling. 2. Observe how yields change with changing practices,

inputs, designs, and management. 3. Understand the changes in energy use, labor, and

profitability that accompany the aforementioned changes. 4. Based on accumulated observations, identify key

indicators of sustainability and continue to monitor them well into the future.

5. Identify indicators that are “farmer friendly” and

can be adapted to on-farm, farmer-based monitoring programs, but that are linked to our understanding of ecological sustainability.

Each season, research results, site-specific ecological factors, farmer skill and knowledge, and new techniques and practices can all be examined to determine if any modifications in management practices need to be made to overcome any identified yield-limiting factors. Ecological components of the sustainability of the system become identifiable at this time, and eventually can be combined with an analysis of economic sustainability as well.

The ultimate success of the conversion process will depend on changes in the attitudes, values, choices, and ethics of everyone in the food system. As these changes become manifest, a new culture of sustainability will emerge, encouraging the research and innovation that will move us beyond the mere substitution of inputs and practices to the redesigning of agroecosystems and to the transformation of the entire food system.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. What are some of the forces that are undercutting

the long-term ecological sustainability of many traditional farming systems, and how might these forces be counteracted?

2. If you were to take over managing a farm in your

community that has a long history of industrialstyle or conventional management, what are some of the changes you would make first in order to begin the process of moving the farm to sustainable management? 3. How much time do you think is necessary for con verting a farm from nonsustainable to sustainable management? What variables might influence the length of the conversion period? 4. What are some of the incentives that might be pro vided for farmers who are considering converting their farms to ecologically based management? 5. From an ecological perspective, why is the substitu tion level of conversion not enough?
