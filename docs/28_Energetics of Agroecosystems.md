## chapter 20. Energetics of Agroecosystems

Energy is the lifeblood of ecosystems and of the biosphere as a whole. At the most fundamental level, what ecosystems do is capture and transform energy.

Energy is constantly flowing through ecosystems in one direction. It enters as solar energy and is converted by photosynthesizing organisms (plants and algae) into potential energy, which is stored in the chemical bonds of organic molecules, or biomass. Whenever this potential energy is harvested by organisms to do work (e.g., grow, move, reproduce), much of it is transformed into heat energy that is no longer available for further work or transformation—it is lost from

the ecosystem.

Agriculture, in essence, is the human manipulation of the capture and flow of energy in ecosystems. Humans use agroecosystems to convert solar energy into particular forms of biomass—forms that can be used as food, feed, fiber, and fuel.

All agroecosystems—from the simple, localized plantings and harvests of the earliest agriculture to the intensively altered agroecosystems of today—require an input of energy from their human stewards in addition to that provided by the sun. This input is necessary in part because of the heavy removal of energy from agroecosystems in the form of harvested material. But it is also necessary because an agroecosystem must to some extent deviate from, and be in opposition to, natural processes. Humans must intervene in a variety of ways—manage noncrop plants and herbivores, irrigate, cultivate soil, and so on—and doing so requires work.

The agricultural “modernization” of the last several decades has been largely a process of putting ever greater amounts of energy into agriculture in order to increase yields. But most of this additional energy input comes directly or indirectly from nonrenewable fossil fuels. Moreover, the return on the energy investment in industrial agriculture is not very favorable: for many crops, we invest more energy than we get back as food energy. Emissions from this process have also contributed to climate change. Our energy-­ intensive form of agriculture, therefore, cannot be sustained into the future without fundamental changes.

**ENERGY AND THE LAWS OF**

**THERMODYNAMICS**

An examination of the energy flows and inputs in agriculture requires a basic understanding of energy and the physical laws that govern it. First of all, what is energy? Energy

is most commonly defined as the ability to do work. Work occurs when a force acts over some distance. When energy is actually doing work it is called kinetic energy. There is kinetic energy, for example, in a swinging hoe and a moving plow, and also in the light waves coming from the sun. Another form of energy is potential energy, which is energy at rest yet capable of doing work. When kinetic energy is doing work, some of it can be stored as potential energy. The energy in the chemical bonds of biomass is a form of potential energy.

In the physical world and in ecosystems, energy is constantly moving from one place to another and changing forms. Two laws of thermodynamics describe how this occurs. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy is neither created nor destroyed regardless of what transfers or transformations occur. Energy changes from one form to another as it moves from one place to another or is used to do work, and all of it can be accounted for. For example, the heat energy and light energy created by the burning of wood (plus the potential energy of the remaining products) is equal to the potential energy of the unburned wood and the oxygen consumed during the burning.

The second law of thermodynamics states that when energy is transferred or transformed, part of the energy is converted to a form that cannot be passed on any further and is not available to do work. This degraded form of energy is heat, which is simply the disorganized movement of molecules. The second law of thermodynamics means that there is always a tendency toward greater disorder, or entropy. To counter entropy—to create order, in other words—energy must be expended.

The operation of the second law can be clearly seen in a natural ecosystem: as energy is transferred from one organism to another in the form of food, a large part of that energy is degraded to heat through metabolic activity, with a net increase in entropy. In another sense, biological systems don’t appear to conform to the second law because they are able to create order out of disorder. They are only able to do this, however, because of the constant input of energy from outside the system in the form of solar

energy.

Analysis of energy flows in any system requires measuring energy use. Many units are available for this purpose. In this chapter, we will use kilocalories (kcal) as the preferred unit because it is best oriented to linking human nutrition with energy inputs in food production. Other units and their equivalents are listed in Table 20.1.

The starting point in the flow of energy through ecosystems and agroecosystems is the sun. The energy emitted by the sun is captured by plants and converted to stored chemical energy through the photosynthetic process discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. The energy accumulated by plants through photosynthesis is called **primary production** because it is the first and most basic form of energy storage in an ecosystem. Energy left after the respiration needed to maintain plants is net primary production (NPP) and remains as stored biomass. Through agriculture, we concentrate this stored energy in biomass that can be harvested and utilized, either by consuming it directly or by feeding it to animals that we can either consume or use to do work for us.

Plants vary in how efficiently they can capture solar energy and convert it to stored biomass. This variation is the result of differences in plant morphology (e.g., leaf area), photosynthetic efficiency, and physiology. It also depends on the conditions under which the plant is grown. Agricultural plants are some of the most efficient plants, but even in their case the efficiency of their conversion of sunlight to biomass rarely exceeds 1% (a 1% efficiency means that 1% of the solar energy reaching the plant is converted to biomass).

Corn, considered one of the most productive food and feed crops per unit of area of land, can produce as much as 15,000 kg/ha/season of dry biomass, divided equally between grain and stover. This biomass represents about 0.5% of the solar energy reaching the corn field during the year (or about 1% of the sunlight reaching the field during the growing season). A potato crop that yields 40,000 kg/ha of fresh tubers (the equivalent of 7,000 kg/ha of dry matter) has a conversion efficiency of about 0.4%. Wheat, with a grain yield of 2700 kg/ha and a dry matter yield of 6750 kg/ha, has about a 0.2% conversion efficiency. The conversion efficiency of sugarcane in tropical areas—about 4.0%—is one of the highest known.

Even though these efficiencies are relatively low, they are still several times greater than the average conversion efficiency of mature natural vegetation, which is estimated to be

**FIGURE 20.1** E **fficiency of solar energy-to-biomass conver-** **sion.** (Data from Pimentel, D. et al., _Bioscience_, 28, 376, 1978; Ludlow, M.M., _Aust. J.

about 0.1% (Pimentel 2012). We must also take into consideration the fact that little of the biomass in natural vegetation is available for human consumption, whereas a large portion of the stored energy in agricultural species is consumable (Figure 20.1).

Since much of the food consumed in developed countries is not plant biomass but animal biomass, we should also examine the efficiency of the conversion from plantmatter energy to meat, milk, and eggs. The production of animal biomass from plant biomass is inefficient because animals lose so much metabolic energy to maintenance and respiration.

Analysis of this conversion is normally done in terms of the energy content of the protein in the animal biomass, since meat, milk, and eggs are produced mainly for their protein. Feedlot or confined livestock need 20–120 units of plant food energy to produce each unit of protein energy, depending on the animal and the production system. This is equivalent to an efficiency of 0.8% at the low end and 5% at the high end. If these conversion efficiencies are combined with those for the production of the animals’ feed, the inefficiency of animal production systems becomes evident. As an example, the plant products fed to feedlot cattle contain about 0.5% of the solar energy that reached the plants, and the protein in the consumed meat of the cattle contains 0.8% of the energy that was in the feed, yielding an overall efficiency of only 0.004% (Figure 20.2).

Open-range livestock must be considered somewhat differently, since they can graze on land that might not be suitable for other forms of agriculture, and consume forage directly from a natural ecosystem or low energy-requiring pasture systems. They can transform the energy contained in biomass that humans cannot consume directly.

Energetics of Agroecosystems **255**

called **ecological energy inputs**, and those derived from human sources, called **cultural energy inputs** . Cultural energy inputs can be further divided into biological inputs and industrial inputs. Biological inputs come directly from organisms and include human labor, animal labor, and manure; industrial inputs of energy are derived from fossil fuels, radioactive fission, and geothermal and hydrological sources (Figure 20.3).

It is important to note that even though we are referring to all these sources of energy as “inputs,” cultural energy of either form can be derived from sources within a particular agroecosystem, making it not an input at all in the sense that we have been using the term. Such “internal inputs” of energy include the labor of farm residents, the manure of onfarm animals, and energy from on-farm windmills or winddriven turbines.

**ENERGY INPUTS IN FOOD PRODUCTION**

Although all the energy in the food we consume comes originally from the sun, additional energy is needed to produce the food in the context of an agroecosystem. This additional energy comes in the form of human labor, animal labor, and the work done by machines. Energy is also required to produce the machines, tools, seed, and fertilizer, to provide irrigation, to process the food, and to transport it to market. We must examine all these energy inputs to understand the energy costs of agriculture and to develop a basis for more sustainable use of energy in agriculture.

It is helpful, first of all, to distinguish between the different types of energy inputs in agriculture. The primary distinction is between energy inputs from solar radiation,

Sources of energy for food production

**Ecological energy** Solar energy: source of energy for production of biomass

From the standpoint of sustainability, the key aspect of energy flow in agroecosystems is how cultural energy is used to direct the conversion of ecological energy to biomass. The greater the modification of natural processes that humans try to force on the environment in the production of food, the greater the amount of cultural energy required. Energy is needed to maintain a low-diversity system, to limit interference, and to modify the physical and chemical conditions of the system in order to maintain optimal growth and development of the crop organisms.

Larger inputs of cultural energy enable higher productivity. However, there is not a one-to-one relationship between the two. When the cultural energy input is very high, the “return” on the “investment” of the extra cultural energy is often minimal. Since the output of an agroecosystem can be measured in terms of energy, we can evaluate the efficiency of energy use in the agroecosystem with a simple ratio: the amount of energy contained in the harvested biomass compared to the amount of cultural energy required to produce that biomass. Across all the world’s agroecosystems, this ratio varies from one in which much more energy comes out

**FIGURE 20.3** **Types of energy inputs in agriculture.** Biological cultural energy and industrial cultural energy can either come from outside a particular agroecosystem (in which case it is a form of external human input) or be derived from sources with the system.

**256** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

than is put in to one in which the energy inputs are larger than the energy output.

Nonmechanized agroecosystems (e.g., pastoralism or shifting cultivation) that use only biological cultural energy in the form of human labor are able to realize returns that

vary from 5 to nearly 40 cal of food energy for each calorie of cultural energy invested. Permanent farming systems using draft animals have a higher input of cultural energy, but because this greater energy investment enables higher yields, such systems still have favorable returns on their investment of cultural energy.

In mechanized agroecosystems, however, very large inputs of industrial cultural energy replace most of the biological cultural energy, enabling high levels of yield but greatly reducing energy use efficiency. In the production of grains such as corn, wheat and rice, these agroecosystems can yield 1–3 cal of food energy per calorie of cultural energy. In mechanized fruit and vegetable production, the energy return is at best slightly greater than the energy investment, and in most cases it is smaller (Pimentel and Pimentel 2008). For production of animal food, the ratio is in most cases even less favorable. Beef production in

the United States, for example, requires about 5 cal of cultural energy for each calorie obtained, and pork requires as much as 10 cal (Pimentel and Pimentel 2008).

Since animal foods are valued more for protein content than total energy content, we should also consider the energy efficiency of their production in terms of the energy in the protein of these foods compared to the energy in the feed consumed by the animals. In these terms, each calorie of protein in milk, pork, and feedlot beef requires between 30 and 80 cal of energy to produce. By comparison, a calorie of plant protein can be produced with as little as 3 cal of cultural energy (in the case of protein from grains). Even the production of concentrated plant protein (e.g., tofu from soybeans) takes no more than 20 cal of energy for each calorie of protein.

The data presented in Figure 20.4 reinforce our claim that the cultural energy requirement in agriculture is closely related to the level of modification of natural ecosystem processes. The costs are small when humans leave the basic

structure of the ecosystem intact. When certain minor modifications are made that increase the abundance of a specific crop species of interest, more cultural energy is required, but

shown by the previous natural system, the levels of cultural energy required can be very high (Figure 20.5).

Figure 20.6 offers another perspective on the relative energy costs and energy benefits of different types of agroecosystems. Although using a large amount of cultural energy enables industrial agroecosystems to be more productive than others, such systems are not realizing a good return on their energy investment. Food production that is more energy efficient is possible if we decrease inputs of industrial cultural energy, increase the investment of biological cultural energy, and change how industrial cultural energy is used.

Biological cultural energy is any energy input with a biological source under human control—this includes human labor, the labor of human-directed animals and their byproducts, and any human-directed biological activity or byproduct. Some of the different forms of biological cultural energy, with their approximate energy values, are presented in Table 20.2.

**FIGURE 20.5** **Coffee grown under the shade of native trees** **in Veracruz, Mexico.** In this agroecosystem, coffee is substituted for understory species without major alteration of the upper canopy of native trees. Because the natural ecosystem is altered so little, only small inputs of cultural energy are required to maintain the productivity of the system.

the return is still favorable (Figure 20.5). But when a complex natural ecosystem is replaced by a crop monoculture with a life form very different from that of the native species—as is the case with irrigated cotton in the former arid scrublands of the western San Joaquin Valley of California—cultural energy costs rise steeply. When the goal is to also increase the level of solar energy capture (productivity) above that

Biological cultural energy is renewable in that it derives from food energy, the ultimate source of which is solar energy. Biological cultural energy is also efficient in facilitating the production of harvestable biomass. As we saw earlier, agroecosystems that rely mainly on biological cultural energy are able to obtain the most favorable ratios of energy output to input.

Human labor has been the key cultural energy input to agriculture ever since its beginning, and in many parts of the world today it continues to be the primary energy input, along with animal labor. In shifting cultivation systems, for example, human labor is practically the only form of energy added other than the energy captured through photosynthesis.

Only the axe and hoe (used for clearing and seed planting) required an input of industrial cultural energy.

produced to cultural energy invested, ranging from 10:1 to 40:1, are a reflection of how efficiently human labor can direct the conversion of solar energy into harvestable material (Rappaport 1971; Pimentel and Pimentel 2008). As an example, the energy budget for a traditional shifting cultivation or swidden corn crop in Mexico is shown in Figure 20.7.

Many other types of traditional, nonmechanized food production systems, where biological cultural energy is the primary input, realize a very favorable return on their investment of cultural energy. In pastoral agroecosystems, in which herding and animal care are the main human activities, and animals gain their food energy from natural vegetation, the ratios of food energy produced to cultural energy invested

range from 3:1 to 10:1. Even intensive, nonmechanized farming systems maintain a positive energy budget. Paddy rice production systems in parts of Southeast Asia, for example, are able to gain up to 38 cal of food energy for every calorie of cultural energy invested.

The energy value of the human labor in these systems is calculated by determining how many food calories a person burns while working. Although this technique provides good baseline data, it does not take into account a variety of other factors. One could also consider the energy required to grow the food that is metabolized while working, and the energy needed to provide for all the other basic needs of the human workers when they aren’t working. Such additions would increase the energy value of human labor. On the other hand, people’s basic needs must be provided for whether or not their labor serves as an energy input in agriculture, and they need food even when at rest. On this basis, one could reduce the energy cost of human labor by considering only the extra food energy needed to perform agricultural work.

In many agroecosystems that rely mainly on biological cultural energy, animals play an important role in cultivating the soil, transporting materials, converting biomass into manure, and producing protein-rich foods such as milk and meat. Animal use increased considerably in agriculture when the transition from shifting cultivation to permanent agriculture and domestication began to occur (Figure 20.8).

Although the use of animal labor increases the total biological cultural energy input and lowers the ratio of harvested energy to invested energy to the neighborhood of 3:1, it allows for permanent instead of shifting agriculture, increases the area that can be planted, produces manures for enriching the soil, and allows for the harvest of meat, milk, and animal products. In addition, animals consume biomass that cannot be consumed directly by humans, which lowers their relative energy cost. An example of the energy efficiency of corn production using animal traction is presented in Figure 20.9.

**FIGURE 20.8** **Oxen-drawn plow cultivating a field for corn** **planting near Cuenca, Ecuador.** Most of the energy in this system is from renewable local sources.

Biological cultural energy is an important component of sustainable agriculture. Energy inputs from humans and their animals are generally renewable, providing energy that helps transform a greater proportion of solar energy into harvestable food energy. The use of human and animal labor takes advantage of the first law of thermodynamics by altering natural ecosystem processes in ways that concentrate energy in useful products, but still obeys the second law by always returning to ecological inputs of energy from the sun in order

to maintain the agroecosystem over the long term. When doing an energetic analysis of biological cultural energy, it must be remembered that this form of energy is more than an economic cost for agriculture—it is an integral part of a sustainable production process.

Once agriculture began to mechanize, the use of energy from industrial cultural sources increased dramatically. Mechanization and industrial cultural energy greatly increased productivity, but they also changed the nature of agricultural production. Human and animal labor were displaced, and farming became tied to fossil-fuel production and consumption.

Present-day industrial agroecosystems have come to rely heavily on industrial cultural energy inputs. Corn production in the United States is a good example of an agroecosystem where almost all of the energy inputs to the system come from industrial sources. Figure 20.10 shows the total energy inputs per hectare in corn production, and how this energy is distributed among the various input types. Biological cultural energy in the form of human labor is a minimal part of this system.

The changes that have occurred since World War II in the way cultural energy is used to produce corn are a good example of how energy use has changed in agriculture in general. Between 1945 and 1983, corn yields in the United States increased threefold, but energy inputs increased more than fivefold. In 1945, the estimated ratio of energy output to energy input in corn was between 3.5:1 and 5.5:1. By 1975,

(Data from Pimentel, D. and Wen, D., Technological changes in energy use in U.S. agricultural production, in: Carrol, C.R., Vandermeer, J.H., and Rosset, P.M. (eds.), _Agroecology_, McGraw Hill, New York, 1990, pp. 147–164.)

**260** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

this ratio had declined to between 3.2:1 and 4.1:1, and in the early 1990s, it stood at 2.53:1 (Pimentel and Pimentel 2008). During the last decade, this ratio of return has probably remained about the same, with the continued intensification of inputs to agriculture balanced by tailoring of inputs to measured crop needs (“precision agriculture”).

Energetically speaking, industrial cultural energy is of a higher quality than both solar energy and biological cultural energy. It is more concentrated—calorie for calorie, it has a greater capacity for doing work than solar energy or biological cultural energy. One kcal of energy in the form of fossil fuel, for example, is able to do about 2000 times as much work as 1 kcal of solar radiation.

But even though industrial cultural energy is generally of very high quality in terms of the work it can do, each form of this energy varies in the amount of energy that was required to give it this higher-quality state. A kilocalorie of electricity, for example, can do four times the work of a kilocalorie of petroleum fuel, but much more energy was expended to create the electricity. As the laws of thermodynamics tell us, humans must expend energy in order to concentrate energy, and no new energy can be created in the process. So we are as much concerned with the absolute amount of work that

can be done by each kilocalorie of a certain form of energy as we are with the total amount of energy that is expended to transform it into that energy form. To compare industrial cultural energy inputs in these terms, we can calculate their energy costs. Table 20.3 presents a range of energy costs for some commonly used industrial energy inputs.

Industrial cultural energy is used either directly or indirectly in agriculture. Direct use occurs when industrial cultural energy is used to power tractors and transport vehicles, run processing machinery and irrigation pumps, and heat and cool greenhouses. Indirect energy use occurs when industrial cultural energy is used off the farm to produce the machinery, vehicles, chemical inputs, and other goods and services

that are then employed in the farming operation. This energy is sometimes referred to as embodied energy, or _emergy_, in order to emphasize the energy costs that are often overlooked when we calculate the direct energy consumed in a farming system (Odum 1996). In the typical industrial farming system, about one-third of energy use is direct, and two-thirds is indirect.

The production of fertilizers—especially nitrogen fertilizer—accounts for the great majority of indirect energy use in agriculture. Nearly one-third of _all_ the energy used in modern agriculture is consumed in the production of nitrogen fertilizer. This energy cost is high because nitrogen fertilizer is used so intensively and because a large amount of energy is required to produce it. In corn production, for example, about 152 kg/ha of N fertilizer is applied to the field, which represents 30% of the total energy input per hectare (Pimentel and Pimentel 2008). This energy input could be reduced greatly by using manures, biological nitrogen fixation, and recycling.

Another 15% of indirect energy use occurs in the production of pesticides. When formulation, packaging, and transport to the farm are included, the energy cost is somewhat higher. Although newer pesticides are usually applied in smaller quantities than those common a few decades ago, they are typically higher in energy content.

Most of the industrial cultural energy inputs in agriculture, both direct and indirect, come from fossil fuels or are dependent on fossil fuels for their manufacture. Other sources of industrial energy play a very small role in agriculture overall, even though they may be significant on a local basis. An analysis of the energy budget for corn production in the Midwestern United States showed that more than

90% of the industrial energy inputs came from fossil fuels, and less than 1% of the total energy needed for production came from renewable biological cultural energy in the form of labor (Pimentel and Wen 1990). When crop production depends so fully on fossil fuels, anything that affects the cost or availability of such energy can have dramatic impacts on agriculture.

Current trends indicate that fossil-fuel use in agriculture will continue to increase to meet growing production needs (Pimentel and Pimentel 2008), resulting in more rapid depletion of world petroleum reserves, greater contribution to carbon emissions and climate change, and competition with other uses for fossil fuels.

**ENERGY IN AGROECOSYSTEMS**

Examining conventional agriculture through the lens of energy reveals a critical source of unsustainability. Industrial agriculture is today using more energy to produce, process, transport, and market food than the food itself contains, and most of this invested energy comes from sources with a finite supply. We have come to depend on fossil fuels to produce our food, yet fossil fuels will not always be available in abundant supply, and they will not always be relatively cheap in dollar terms. Moreover, dependence on fossil-fuel

use in agriculture is linked with virtually every other source of unsustainability in our food production systems.

Growing levels of energy inputs to agriculture have played an important role in increasing yield levels in many of the world’s agricultural ecosystems over the past several decades. However, as described earlier, most of these energy inputs come from industrial sources, and most are based on the use of fossil fuels. If the strategy for meeting the food demands of the growing population of the world continues to depend on these sources, the consequences will continue to undermine the ecological foundations of agriculture, increase economic risk, and cause social problems.

Most directly, fossil-fuel use in agriculture will continue to represent a large share of the world’s total carbon emissions, contributing significantly to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and helping to drive climate change. Other problems with agriculture’s dependence on fossil fuels are more indirect, a result of how the energy intensiveness of fossil fuel enables the food system to function. As has been noted throughout the chapters of this book, when ecological processes are ignored, environmental degradation begins to appear in the agroecosystem. The use of intensive cultural energy inputs is what has permitted us to ignore ecological processes. The application of inorganic fertilizers masks declines in soil fertility; pesticides contribute to and hide declines in agricultural biodiversity.

However, the consequences of ignoring ecological processes are now becoming more evident. At the farm level, a shift to heavy mechanization and high use of fossil-fuelderived chemical inputs have led to problems of organic matter loss, nutrient leaching, soil degradation, and increased soil erosion. Water supplies have become polluted, and excessive pumping of the groundwater has led to exhaustion of aquifers and accompanying water shortages. Pests and diseases have developed resistance to inundative use of pesticides, and pesticides have contaminated both farm environments and natural ecosystems, causing health problems for farmers and farmworkers and destroying populations of beneficial insects and microorganisms.

Off the farm, the wind and water erosion of soil associated with mechanized agriculture has had negative impacts on other systems, especially downstream. A recent work on gaseous emissions from nitrogenous fertilizers (N 2 O and NO) has shown that the addition of these materials to the atmosphere is beginning to impact the global nitrogen cycle, further damage the ozone layer, and exacerbate climate change (Fields 2004). The simplification of farming systems, which always accompanies high industrial energy inputs to agriculture, is causing greater loss of regional biodiversity.

From an economic and social perspective, the problems with excessive dependence on fossil-fuel energy in agriculture go much beyond the issue of the efficiency of return on

investment for the energy that is used. Dependence on fossilfuel use means greater vulnerability to changes in the price and supply of petroleum. As was seen in the oil crisis of 1973, and then periodically since then, petroleum prices can suddenly rise, increasing the costs of agricultural production. With fossil-fuel consumption continuing to rise worldwide, the risks to fossil-fuel-based agriculture become even greater. The problem will become even more critical as developing countries are forced to intensify their own agricultural output to meet the growing demand for food.

A final problem with fossil-fuel-based agriculture is that it is linked to a certain kind of agricultural development: it enables large-scale, mechanized agriculture, which all over the world is displacing traditional agriculture and thus forcing migration to cities, disrupting cultural ties, and undermining self-reliance.

Clearly, sustainable food production depends to a large extent on more efficient use of energy, as well as less reliance on industrial cultural energy inputs and fossil fuels in particular. As suggested in this chapter, a key to more sustainable use of energy in agriculture is expanding the use of biological cultural energy. Biological inputs are not only renewable, they have the advantages of being locally available and locally controlled, environmentally benign, and able to contribute to the ecological soundness of agroecosystems. Also important is the conversion to alternative energy sources and appropriate technologies that lessen dependence on fossil fuel.

Many agroecosystems currently in use point the way toward the future. The typical organic farming system, in which animals and legumes replace some of the fossilfuel-derived inputs, consumes 28%–32% less energy than an equivalent industrial/conventional system (Pimentel et al. 2005). A Danish study found that a grass–clover integrated organic dairy farm was able to reduce total energy use 37.5% over its conventional counterpart, and systems using legume rotations in organic cereals and row crops reduced total energy use by 81.5% and 75% respectively, compared to conventional systems (Dalgaard et al. 2001; Dalgaard 2013).

Many of the ecologically based options and approaches presented throughout this book relate directly to improving energy efficiency. They suggest a number of strategies for fashioning food production systems that use energy in a more sustainable manner:

1. Reduce the use of industrial cultural energy, espe cially nonrenewable or contaminating sources such as fossil fuels.

a. Use minimum or reduced-tillage systems that

require less mechanized cultivation. b. Employ practices that reduce water use and

water loss in order to reduce the amount of

energy expended for irrigation.

**262** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

c. Use appropriate crop rotations and associations

that stimulate recovery from the disturbance caused by each cropping cycle without the need for artificial inputs. d. Develop renewable, energy-efficient industrial

cultural sources and uses of energy to replace fossil fuels and their uses.

e. Develop on-farm sources of industrial cultural

energy (e.g., photovoltaic electricity, wind energy, small-scale hydropower, biofuels) where possible. f. Use industrial cultural energy more efficiently

by reducing waste and making more appropriate matches between the energy’s quality and its

use.

g. Reduce the consumption of animal products

overall, and for the animal products that are consumed, rely more on livestock that are range or grass fed or raised on agricultural plant biomass that would otherwise be waste.

h. Reduce energy use in the agricultural sector by

regionalizing production, and putting consumers and producers more directly in contact both seasonally and geographically. 2. Increase the use of biological cultural energy. a. View human energy as an integral part of

energy flow in agriculture rather than as an economic cost that must be reduced or eliminated.

b. Return harvested nutrients to the farmland from

which they came. c. Make more extensive use of manures and plant

by-products to maintain soil fertility and quality. d. Design and implement integrated livestock and

crop systems that harness the ability of livestock to supply work, recycle nutrients on the farm, and provide other ecosystem services (see Chapter 19). e. Increase the local and on-farm use of agricul tural products in order to lessen the energy costs of long-distance transport. f. Expand the use of biological control and inte grated pest management. g. Encourage the presence of mycorrhizal relation ships in the roots of crops in order to lessen the need for external inputs. 3. Design agroecosystems in which biological and

ecological relationships provide more of the nutrient and biomass inputs and population-regulating processes, and that therefore require lower levels of cultural energy inputs. a. Make greater use of nitrogen-fixing crops, green

manures, and fallows. b. Make greater use of biological pest management

through covercropping, intercropping, encouragement of beneficials, well-designed livestock integration, etc.

c. Introduce crops that are appropriate or adapted

to the local environment rather than trying to alter the environment to meet the needs of the

crop. d. Incorporate windbreaks, hedgerows, and non crop areas into cropping systems for habitat and microclimate management. e. Design agroecosystems using local natural eco systems as a model. f. Maximize the use of successional development

in the cropping system (e.g., through agroforestry) in order to maintain better agroecosystem regeneration capacity. g. Diversify rather than simplify farming systems. 4. Emphasize agroecosystem design and management

approaches that store carbon in biomass or soil organic matter in order to make agriculture a net sink for carbon, and, hence, a force for counteracting climate change. 5. Develop energy-related indicators of sustainability

that incorporate the parallel goals of efficiency, productivity, and renewability (see Chapter 23).

Too often we hear the argument that without the continued intensive use of fossil fuels, agriculture will not be able to meet the growing demand for food around the globe. Although this point of view highlights the main challenge we will face in the coming decades, it ignores both the seriousness of the problems caused by our present methods of food production and the very real and practical alternatives that exist and that can be developed if research is directed toward whole-system analysis of agroecosystems.

Nor can we rely on biofuel substitutes for fossil fuels. The current push to develop biofuels has considerable risk because biofuel production diverts biomass and food products away from direct human consumption and use in agriculture (Hunt et al. 2006). Moreover, biofuels rarely have a positive energy balance. For example, producing 1000 L of ethanol requires 8.3 million kcal of energy (much of it from fossil fuels) but that same 1000 L of ethanol has an energy value of only 5.0 million kcal (Pimentel et al. 1998). Although biofuels have their place in developing more sustainable agroecosystems, they are not the easy solution that some claim.

The rapid increase in energy use in agriculture during the twentieth century radically changed the nature of farming. With an understanding of energy as an ecological factor in agriculture, and its use and flow as an emergent quality of the entire agroecosystem, better means of evaluating current practices can be developed, contributing at the same time to the development of practices and policies that establish a more sustainable basis for the world’s food production systems in the twenty-first century. The longer it takes to develop alternative, ecologically sound energy use and conversion systems, the more vulnerable our current energy-dependent systems will become.

**CASE STUDY: SUNSHINE FARM PROJECT**

Before the mid-1900s, many farms ran mostly on sunlight. They used crop rotations and farm-produced manure to maintain soil fertility, and work was done by draft horses and people fed by on-farm production. With these farms of 100 years ago in mind, Marty Bender at the Land Institute set out in the early 1990s to create a modern farm that could provide its own fuel and fertility. The result was the Sunshine Farm, a 10-year-long demonstration project consisting of 50 acres of conventional crops and 100 acres of prairie pasture grazed by cattle near Salina, Kansas.

As the farm took shape, it showed many similarities to farms of the early 1900s and before. Livestock and crops were integrated, draft horses performed work, a variety of crops were grown, and at any one time about 40% of the cropland was planted in legumes. Unlike a farmer in the 1920s, however, Bender had at his disposal some newer renewable energy technologies.

He had a 4.5 kW photovoltaic array installed to provide for all of the farm’s electricity needs, which included running the workshop tools, charging the electric fencing, running the water pumps, heating the chick brooders, and providing electricity for the farmhouse. A pair of Percheron draft horses and a biodiesel tractor provided motive power for field operations. Bender planted about one-quarter of the farm’s cropland in soybeans and sunflowers to provide the raw material for the tractor’s biodiesel fuel; however, since on-farm processing was not feasible, the oilseed was sold to a local cooperative, and an equivalent amount of biodiesel fuel purchased.

The livestock side of the farm’s commercial enterprises consisted of a beef cattle operation, along with poultry raised to produce eggs and broilers. About three-fourths of the feed for these animals (and the draft horses) was produced on the farm. On the crop side, wheat was grown for sale, and excess oilseed meal was also sold. The major components of the farm operation are listed in Table 20.4.

Energy accounting was a crucial facet of the Sunshine Farm project. Bender and colleagues carefully measured the weight of every farm input and output, using energy factors published in the academic literature to derive equivalent energy values. These data were painstakingly entered into a database, and used to generate energy budgets for the farm as a whole and for its constituent enterprises. These budgets included both direct and indirect energy costs.

The energy accounting showed that over the course of the demonstration, about 90% of the farm’s energy needs—not counting the energy embodied in capital outlays and human labor—were supplied by on-farm inputs. The remaining 10% was the energy embodied in purchased seed and feed, and in the phosphorus and potassium removed in the marketed crops (Bender 2002; Baum et al. 2009).

The Sunshine Farm project served many purposes. Primarily, it demonstrated that farming operations can come close to attaining energy self-sufficiency without sacrificing yields. It showed that many traditional farming practices—rotations, green manuring, livestock integration, crop diversity, and use of draft animals—can be essential components of energy-efficient agroecosystems, and that modern alternative energy technologies can also play an important role. In addition, it showed that increasing the energy self-sufficiency of individual farms is not the only means of reducing agriculture’s dependence on fossil fuels. Farms may also need to be integrated into a local renewable energy economy, as the Sunshine Farm did in growing oilseed but leaving biodiesel fuel production to a largerscale cooperative, and in tying its photovoltaic array into the local power grid.
