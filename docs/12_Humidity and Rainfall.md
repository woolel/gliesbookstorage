## 6. Humidity and Rainfall

A place’s natural vegetation is usually a reliable indicator of
its rainfall regime. Deserts, with their sparse, slow-growing
vegetation, tell the observer that the local annual rainfall is
minimal. The lush vegetative growth of tropical and temperate rainforests points to abundant rainfall through at least
most of the year. Rainfall amounts and vegetation have this
direct relationship because for most terrestrial ecosystems,
water is the most important limiting factor.

Water is also a primary limiting factor in agroecosystems.
Agriculture can be practiced only where there is adequate
rainfall or where it is possible to overcome, through irrigation, the limits imposed by a dry climate. In this chapter we
discuss water in three successive contexts: as it exists in the

atmosphere, as it falls to earth in the form of precipitation
and is cycled back into the atmosphere, and as it affects agroecosystems on the ground.


**WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE**


Water can exist in the atmosphere in a gaseous form (as water
vapor) or in a liquid form (as droplets). At constant pressure, the amount of water vapor that air can hold before it
becomes saturated and its water vapor begins to condense
and form droplets is dependent on temperature. As the temperature of the air goes down, the amount of water that can
be held in vapor form goes down as well. Because of this
dependence on temperature, humidity—the amount of moisture in the air—is usually measured in relative terms rather
than according to the absolute amount of moisture in the air.
**Relative humidity** is the ratio of the water vapor content of
the air to the amount of water vapor the air can hold at that
temperature. At a relative humidity of 50%, for example, the
air is holding 50% of the water vapor it could hold at that
temperature. When the relative humidity is 100%, the air is
saturated with water vapor, and water vapor begins to condense to form mist, fog, and clouds.

Relative humidity can change as a result of either changes
in the absolute amount of water vapor or changes in temperature. If the absolute amount of water vapor in the air is
high, small variations in temperature can greatly influence
relative humidity. A drop of a few degrees in temperature
in the evening or morning hours, for example, can push the
relative humidity to 100%. Once relative humidity reaches
100%, water vapor begins to condense into water droplets,
and shows up as dew. The temperature at which this condensation begins to occur is called the **dew point** .

In natural systems, the interaction of temperature and
the air’s moisture content can be a very important factor in



determining the structure of an ecosystem. The redwood
forest community along the coast of California is a good
example. Cold ocean currents condense the moisture-laden
air over the ocean, forming fog. The occurrence of fog almost
every night during the dry summer months compensates for
the lack of rainfall and is believed to be the main reason red
woods still exist where they do. Some studies estimate that
fog and dew add at least an extra 10% to the effective total of
rainfall for redwood regions.

For similar reasons, humidity can affect agroecosystems.
Crops grown in the redwood forest region, for example, may
benefit from the extra moisture that fog and dew provide;
farmers of crops such as Brussels sprouts, lettuce, and artichokes use less water as a result.


The reader should keep in mind that water in the atmosphere is only one aspect of a larger set of environmental
factors affecting plants—those involving the atmosphere as
a whole. Patterns of movement and change in the atmosphere
influence not only rainfall patterns but also wind and variations in temperature. Combined, atmospheric factors make
up climate (when we are referring to the annual average conditions) and weather (when we are referring to the climatic
conditions at one moment in time).


**PRECIPITATION**


Although dew and fog can contribute significant quantities
of moisture to some regions, the primary (natural) source of
water for agroecosystems is precipitation, usually in the form
of rain or snow. Precipitation contributes moisture to the soil
directly, and in irrigated agroecosystems it does so indirectly
by being the ultimate source of most irrigation water.


**H** **ydrological** **C** **ycle**


Precipitation is part of the **hydrological cycle**, a global process moving water from the earth’s surface to the atmosphere
and back to the earth. A diagram of the hydrological cycle is
presented in Figure 6.1. The core of the hydrological cycle is
made up of the two basic physical processes of evaporation
and condensation. Evaporation occurs at the earth’s surface,
as water evaporates from soil, bodies of water, and other
wet surfaces. Evaporation of water from inside the bodies
of plants also occurs on the surface of leaves. This kind of
evaporation, called transpiration, is part of the mechanism
by which plants draw water from the soil into their roots (see
Chapter 3). Evaporation from all these sources is collectively
termed **evapotranspiration** .

**FIGURE 6.1** **The hydrological cycle.**


When the absolute amount of water vapor in the air is sufficient to approach or exceed 100% relative humidity, condensation begins to occur. Small water droplets form and
aggregate to create clouds. Precipitation occurs when droplets of water in clouds become heavy enough to fall. This
usually happens when the moisture-containing air rises (by
being forced up a mountain by winds or rising on currents
of warm air) and begins to cool. As the air cools, its ability
to hold moisture in vapor form or as very small cloud droplets begins to decrease, resulting in more condensation and
aggregation of droplets. This cooling and condensing process
is called adiabatic cooling. The precipitation formed by adiabatic cooling falls to earth, enters watersheds or the ocean,
and eventually returns to the atmosphere.


**T** **ypes** **of** **R** **ainfall**


The precipitation part of the hydrological cycle is highly
variable. Masses of moisture-laden air are constantly being
moved over the earth’s surface by the complex movements
of the atmosphere. Rainfall (and other forms of precipitation)
occurs locally in different ways depending on latitude, season, temperature, topography, and the movement of the air
masses. In general, however, rainfall can be classified into
three types depending on the mechanism that produces the
adiabatic cooling of the moist air mass.


**Convective Rainfall**

Convective rainfall occurs when high levels of solar gain heat
the air close to the ground, causing it to rise rapidly, cool,
and condense the moisture it contains. Often the rising air
draws moisture-laden air in from some distant source, such
as a lake, gulf, or ocean. The rain associated with summer
thunder clouds is an example of convective rainfall. High
winds, and even tornadoes, can accompany these storms,
as can lightning and localized fires. In many regions, such
as the American Midwest, agroecosystems are dependent
on this type of rainfall, at least at certain times of the year.
Traditional Hopi agriculture in the southwest of the United
States is completely dependent on convective rainfall, with



the torrent that often accompanies these storms being channeled down washes from the mountains and then spread out
over planted fields at the mouths of the canyons.


**Orographic Rainfall**
Orographic rainfall occurs when a moisture-laden air mass
meets a mountain range that forces it up into the cooler
layers of the atmosphere. Such precipitation occurs on the
western flanks of California’s Sierra Nevada—as rain in the
foothills and as snow at the higher elevations. This precipitation is an important replenisher of streams and aquifers,
which later become sources of irrigation water downstream
in drier locations. Agriculture in a region such as the Great
Central Valley of California would not be possible without
orographic precipitation in nearby mountains.


**Cyclonic Rainfall**
This type of rainfall is associated with areas of low atmospheric pressure that form over the ocean. Warm, moistureladen air rises, creating a low-pressure area. As this air rises,
it cools, forms precipitation, and then falls back toward the
ocean surface where it can collect more moisture. In addi
tion, the air currents of this self-perpetuating system begin to
revolve counterclockwise around the low-pressure area, and
the entire system begins to move. The revolving air currents
form the characteristic cyclonic storms and frontal systems
we can see on weather maps. When one of these cyclonic
systems moves ashore, the moisture-laden air masses may
be forced up against mountain masses, creating rainfall with
both orographic and cyclonic causes (Figure 6.2).

typical year, its distribution throughout the year, the intensity
and duration of precipitation events, and the regularity and
predictability of the precipitation patterns are all important
determinants of the opportunities for, and constraints upon,
agriculture in a particular region.

In the following, these facets of rainfall patterns are
described using rainfall data collected by the author in the
Cuyama Valley, CA. These data are shown in Table 6.1.


  - **Average total annual rainfall.** The total amount

of precipitation that falls in an area during an
average year is a good indicator of the moistness
of that area’s climate. From an ecological perspective, however, it is also important to know
how much variability there can be in this rainfall
amount from 1 year to the next. Extremes at either
end of the average can have significant negative
impact on an agricultural system, even if that
extreme only occurs rarely. Table 6.1 shows that
in the Cuyama Valley the annual total is highly
variable: during the 17-year data collection period
there were 8 drought years, 3 years of near-normal
precipitation, 4 wet years, and 2 excessively wet
years (associated with El Niño patterns in the
Pacific Ocean).

  - **Distribution and periodicity.** This refers to how

rainfall is spread out through the year, both on



average and during a specific year. In many parts of
the world, rainfall is distributed in such a way as to
create predictable wet and dry periods; the Cuyama
Valley, where precipitation is largely confined to
the period from October to May, is a good example.
Within this overall climatic distribution pattern,
however, rainfall is often distributed differently
each year: if the data for the Cuyama Valley were
graphed, for example, the peaks and valleys for each
year would not correspond, and some years, such as
2004–2005, would show much more evenly distributed rainfall than others.

- **Intensity and duration.** The absolute amount of

rainfall in a long time period such as a month or
even a day does not fully describe the ecological
relevance of the rainfall. How intense the rainfall

is, and for what length of time that rainfall occurs,
are important aspects. Two inches of rainfall in
less than an hour can have very different ecological impacts than a 2 in. rain spread over 24 h. For
example, of the 12.66 in. of rainfall recorded during
February 1998 in the Cuyama Valley, over 8 in. fell
in one 3 h rainfall event, with associated excessive
runoff and flooding.

- **Availability.** It is also important to know how much

of the rainfall becomes available as soil moisture.

Does it penetrate into the root zone? What were the


**70** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



weather conditions immediately following the rainfall event? What was the temperature and what were
the wind conditions? The dry year of 2011–2012
was accentuated by extremely hot temperatures in
June and July. The 2012–2013 year was extremely
difficult because rainfall occurred as 0.25–0.50 in.
events that did not soak into the root zone and evaporated from the surface.

  - **Predictability.** Every region has a characteristic

degree of variability in its rainfall patterns. The
higher the variability, the less predictable the rainfall for any particular time period. The rainfall
data in Table 6.1 show that the Cuyama Valley has
fairly high variability, for example. Based on these
data, a farmer could not count on there being at
least 1 in. of rain in April, even though the 17-year
average for that month is 1.13 in. And even though
the annual average is about 15 in., in most of the
last 10 years rainfall totals were either much less or
much greater. Such extremes rather than the average are typical of what climate change seems to be
presenting.


Additional aspects of rainfall may be relevant from an agroecological perspective as well. For example, it may be important to know how much moisture was in the soil when rainfall

occurred, as well as the stage of crop development. In the Paso
Robles and Santa Maria regions of California, for example,
two storms with total rainfall of about 1.5 in. occurred during the first 2 weeks of September in 1998. Since most grapes
were still on the vine at this time, the rains damaged the crop
(in most years, significant rainfall does not occur until early
November, after the grapes have been harvested). The lack
of any penetrating rainfall in the latter part of the 2012–2013
year, on the heels of a previous dry year, caused severe plant
stress and significant yield drops.


**RAINFED AGROECOSYSTEMS**


Agriculture in most of the world is carried out using natural
precipitation to meet the water needs of crops. These **rain-**
**fed agroecosystems** must adjust to the distribution, intensity, and variability of the rainfall that is characteristic of the
local climate. The challenge is either to maintain a balance
between precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration,
(PET) by manipulating evapotranspiration or to somehow
work around a water deficit (P – PET < 0) or a water surplus
(P – PET > 0).

Several examples of how agroecosystems function within
the constraints of local rainfall regimes are presented in the
following, providing another way of examining the aspects of
sustainability inherent in farming approaches that work with
ecological conditions rather than striving for their alteration
or control. These examples were chosen to cover the range
from very wet to very dry rainfed agriculture. The aspects of
managing moisture once it gets into the soil will be described
in more detail in Chapter 9.

In very humid regions with extended rainfall, farmers are
concerned more with excess water than with water deficits.
Frequent and heavy rainfall creates problems of waterlogging,
root diseases, nutrient leaching, abundant weed growth, and
complications for most farming operations. Even wetlandadapted crops such as rice or taro are difficult to manage in
regions with a long wet season. Conventional approaches to
excess precipitation most often look to some type of major
habitat modification such as drainage projects and flood control. An agroecological approach to an extended wet season,
in contrast, looks for ways to accommodate the system to the
excess moisture.


A very interesting and productive use of land that is
flooded for the entire wet season is seen in Tabasco, Mexico
(Gliessman 1992a). This region receives more than 3000 mm
of rainfall distributed over a long wet season that extends
from May until February of the next year. The staple local
crop of corn is planted on higher ground around wetlands
that are shallowly flooded during most of the year. In March,
however, the drop in rainfall permits the planting of another
corn crop. Low-lying areas dry out enough for the soil surface to become exposed. Farmers follow the receding water
line with this special corn planting, known locally as the
March planting or _marceño_ .

During much of the year constant rainfall keeps the low
areas inundated to a depth that ranges from a few centimeters
to as much as a meter. The marsh vegetation that densely covers these areas during the wet season is felled quickly with
machetes as the water level recedes. A very dense, 10–20 cm
mat of organic matter is produced by this process. Seed is
planted into holes made with a pointed stick driven into the
mat. About a week after the sowing, fire is used to burn part
of the organic mat, as well as to kill back any weed seedlings or sprouts of the marsh plants. The burning must be
timed so as to burn only the dry leaves on top of the mat and
not the moist lower layers or the soil. The corn seed, planted
10–15 cm below the surface of the soil, is not harmed by
the fire. Local short-cycle varieties of corn (2–3 months from
planting to harvest) are most frequently used. The practice
of using seed from the previous harvest for the subsequent
planting favors the use of local varieties, rather than the purchase of hybrid or “improved” seed produced at distant locations. The name of one corn variety— _mejen_, from a Maya
word meaning “precocious” or “early maturing”—shows the
link to the past that this system may have (Figure 6.3).

The corn grows very quickly in this system, and when
fire is not used excessively and flooding is allowed to occur
every year, weeding is usually not necessary. After about 2½
months of growth the mature cornstalks are “doubled over”
just below the corn ear, facilitating final drying of the grain
for another 2–4 weeks before harvest. Yields of 4–5 tons/ha of

dry grain are common, with some yields reaching 10 tons/ha.
This is many times the average yield of 1–1.5 tons/ha for
mechanized production on lands that have been cleared and
drained in the same region. These greater yields are obtained

at a fraction of the input costs and labor invested in mechanized production systems (Amador 1980).

Following the harvest, all crop and noncrop residues end
up on the soil surface. This contributes to a key element in
the productivity of the system—maintenance of organic matter in the soil. Soil profiles demonstrate the presence of a
thick, organic-rich soil to a depth of 30–40 cm below the
surface. During the 9-month inundation, organic matter
produced by the marsh plants or left by the previous cropping cycle is incorporated into the soil and conserved in the
anoxic conditions under water. In addition, nutrient minerals
that enter the system with surface drainage are captured by
the highly productive aquatic sector of the ecosystem. These
factors result in the formation of a soil that has organic matter
levels over 30%, total nitrogen as high as 3%, and high levels
of other important plant nutrients. The key element in the
management of this system, then, is the way in which inundation during the wet season is taken advantage of. When
the system is drained artificially in an attempt to extend the
cropping season, the organic layer in the soil can be reduced
to 5 cm in less than 2 years, and yields drop dramatically.

Many parts of the world have a monsoon-type climate in
which average annual rainfall is relatively high, but nearly all
the rain falls during a wet season of medium length. Farmers
in these areas have to deal with excess rainfall at one time,

and a lack of rainfall at another.



A very interesting and productive agroecosystem in such
an alternating rainfall regime has been observed in the state
of Tlaxcala, Mexico (Wilken 1969; González Jácome 1986;
Anaya et al. 1987; Crews and Gliessman 1991). In an area
known as the Puebla basin, a triangular floodplain of about
290 km [2] is formed where the Atoyac and Zahuapan rivers
meet in the southern part of the state. Average annual rainfall is about 700 mm. A large part of the basin floor has a
water table <3 ft below the surface during much of the year,
with soils that are poorly drained and swampy. In order to
make such land agriculturally productive, most present-day
agronomists would probably recommend draining the region
so that large-scale mechanized cropping practices could be
introduced. But the local, traditional cropping systems provide an alternative that makes use of the high water table and
rainfall distribution in the watershed (Figure 6.4).

Using a system that is prehispanic in origin, raised platforms (locally called _camellones_ ) have been constructed
from soil excavated from their borders, creating a system of
platforms and canals (called _zanjas_ ). Individual platforms are
15–30 m wide, 2–3 m high, and 150–300 m long. A diverse
mixture of crops are grown on the platforms, including intercropped maize, beans, and squash, vegetables, alfalfa, and
other annuals. Crop rotations with legumes such as alfalfa
or fava beans help maintain soil fertility, and the crop mixtures themselves help in weed control. Soil fertility is also
maintained with frequent applications of composted animal
manures and crop residues. Much of the feed for the animals
comes from alfalfa grown on the platforms, or from residues
of other crops that cannot be directly consumed by humans
(e.g., cornstalks). Supplemental feed for animals is derived
from the noncrop vegetation (i.e., weeds) that is selectively
removed from the crop area, or periodic harvests that are
made of the ruderals and natives that grow either along the
canals or directly in them as aquatic species. This latter


**72** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



source of feed can constitute a very significant component of
livestock diets during the dry season.

A very important aspect of this traditional agroecosystem is the management of the complex set of canals. Besides
originally serving as a primary source of soil for raising the
platform surfaces, they also serve as a major reservoir of
water during the dry season. Organic matter accumulates in
the canals as aquatic plants die, leaves from trees along the
canal borders fall into the water, and even weeds from the
crop field are thrown into the canals. Soil from the surrounding hillsides and the platforms is also washed into the canals
by the heavy wet-season rains. Every 2–3 years the canals
are cleaned of the accumulated soil and muck, with the excavated materials being applied as a nutrient-rich top dressing
on the platforms.

The canals thus play a very important role in the sustainability of this agroecosystem. They function as a nutrient
“sink” for the farmer, and are managed in ways that permit the capture of as much organic material as possible.
Supplemental irrigation water can be taken from them in
the dry season, and the plants rely greatly on moisture that
moves upward through the soil from the water table by
capillarity. The raised platforms provide suitable planting
surface even during the peak of the rains. Water levels in
the canals are controlled by an intricate system of interconnected canals that eventually lead to the rivers of the basin,
but flow in the canals is very limited. Farmers often block
the flow of canals along their fields during the dry season in
order to maintain a higher water table, and even in the wet
season, water flow out of system is minimal. Only at times
of excessive rainfall do appreciable quantities of water
drain from the area. Rainfall is both an input and a tool
in the management of the system, and permits year-round
cropping.

Outside of the wet tropics, a common rainfall regime is
one in which one or more wet seasons are interspersed
with relatively long dry seasons. In these areas, crops are
often planted at the beginning of the rainy season, grow
and develop while there is moisture in the soil, and become
ready to harvest at the end of the wet season or the beginning of the dry season.

This kind of wet-season cropping takes many forms. In
much of the midwestern heartland of the United States, for
example, spring wheat, corn, and soybeans are planted in
the late spring and depend on convective summer rainfall
to develop. In Mediterranean climates around the world, the
mild, wet winters and dry summers are appropriate for grain
crops such as oats, barley, and rye grown in winter, with the
land being left fallow or grazed during the summer unless
irrigation can be provided.

A seasonally rainfed cropping system of considerable
importance is the Mesoamerican corn/bean/squash polyculture system. Adapted to a wide range of rainfall intensities
and amounts, this intercropping system is found throughout



much of Latin America (Pinchinat et al. 1976; Laing et al.
1984; Davis et al. 1986). These three crops are planted in
many different arrangements, sequences, and patterns, sometimes only two of them together, and at other times all three.
But regardless of the combination, it is the arrival of the rainy
season that determines planting.

If shifting cultivation practices are used, clearing and
burning takes place during the dry season. Sometimes farmers wait to burn until after the first rains of the wet season
dampen the lower layers of the slash. Since these first rains
are most often interspersed with periods of sun, the upper
layer of the slash is dried enough between rains to carry a fire,
while the newly acquired moisture below prevents excessive
heat from reaching the soil. Crop seed is then planted into
a mulch made up of nutrient-rich ash and a protective layer
of unburned organic matter. This practice achieves the dual
goals of nutrient supply and soil erosion protection. Soil protection is important in many areas where this crop system is
used, since the early rains of the season occur most often as
intense, convective showers.

Once the rains begin, crop seeds germinate and develop
quickly, covering the soil and protecting it against the continued rains. The amount of time it takes for the crop to
mature (from 4 to 6 months) depends on the length of the

wet season.


In areas such as the wet lowlands of Tabasco, Mexico, two
corn crops can be planted because the wet season is longer
and characterized by a bimodal distribution, with one rainfall peak in June/July and another in September/October.
One crop is planted in May at the beginning of the wet
season, with fire being used to clear the slash, and the crop
(called _milpa de año_ ) being harvested in September. The
second crop (called _tonalmil_ ) is planted just following the
second rainfall peak in late October or November for harvest at the beginning of the dry season in late February. The
second crop depends greatly on the presence of residual soil
moisture extending into the dry season, and since the crop
is planted during the wet season, any slash on the surface at
planting is not burned. Different local varieties of corn are
used in each planting system.

In many parts of the world, rainfall during the cropping season does not meet the needs of the crop, either because the
area does not receive enough rainfall to offset moisture lost
through evapotranspiration, or because the cropping cycle
does not coincide with the wet season. The type of agriculture developed in such climates—when irrigation is not an
option—is termed dryland agriculture or **dry farming** .

Dryland agriculture is defined as crop production without irrigation in semiarid regions of the world where annual
rainfall is mostly between 250 and 500 mm. But total rainfall
is only one influence on dryland agriculture; annual and seasonal variations in temperature and the type and distribution
of rainfall are key factors as well. The traditional agriculture
in most dryland regions is pastoral in nature, with cultivated


Humidity and Rainfall **73**


crops limited to small areas farmed by hand tools or animal
power. Today, mechanization has added a new dimension to
dry farming, but the types of tillage, seeding management,
and harvest procedures remain much the same. In many
countries hand labor still plays a major role.



The most important aspects of dry farming are (1) the use
of some type of cultivation system that promotes the penetration of rainwater into the soil profile and its storage there,
and (2) the frequent use of summer fallows or rest seasons
to allow replenishment of water reserves depleted by cropping. Other practices can be important as well. Cultivation of
the surface soil during the cropping cycle is used to control
potential water-using weeds and to create a “dust mulch” of
pulverized surface soil that reduces the proportion of large
pores, breaks capillary connections, and therefore reduces
evaporation (see Figures 6.5 and 6.6). Drought-resistant cultivars are often planted to reduce moisture use. Altogether,
these practices allow a much higher proportion of the moisture from rainfall to be channeled through the crop rather
than to pass from the soil to the atmosphere.

The most highly developed modern dryland agricultural systems, at least in terms of intensive management
and technology, are in Australia, Canada, and the United
States. In all of these regions, grain crops are the primary
focus. In Australia, however, wheat in rotation with grazing, especially for sheep and wool production, has led to
the development of unique systems where a grain crop is
grown alternately with pasture. Pasture actually allows for

weeds during the rainless summer growing season.


the replenishment of moisture reserves necessary to produce
a grain crop.

A unique example of dry farming occurs in coastal central
California, where several vegetable crops are planted, either
from transplanted seedlings or direct seeding, at the beginning of the dry Mediterranean summer in May. Rarely does
rainfall occur in summer in this climate, so these vegetable
crops must rely solely on the moisture reserves stored in the

**CONDOR’S HOPE RANCH, CUYAMA VALLEY, CA**


Wine grapes and olives have been grown in the semiarid and arid regions around the Mediterranean Sea for several
millennia, and except for very recent historic time were most likely grown without irrigation during the dry time of the
year. Contemporary versions of this nonirrigated grape production system still exist today; in fact in some regions of
southern Europe, it is illegal to irrigate out of concern for the changes that might be wrought in the quality of the wine
produced. When immigrants from these regions came to California, they brought the culture of their dry farming systems with them, and many successful examples of the vineyards they planted are still producing in several well-known
wine-growing regions of the state.

One example of the dry farming of both grapes and olives can be found at Condor’s Hope Ranch in the Cuyama Valley
of northern Santa Barbara County, CA. In a geographic location that receives an average annual rainfall of 12–15 in., this
small family-owned and operated farm is considered to be on the margin for successful dry farming. But both grapes (first
planted in 1994) and olives (planted in the year 2000) have been successfully grown and yield wine and oil of excellent
quality. Despite the fact that some years have lower-than-average rainfall (see Table 6.1), the rain that does fall each winter
maintains enough moisture in the soil so that the plants can withstand even dry years with little or no dry-season irrigation.

When new grapes are planted, very light and frequent waterings are applied during the first year using an underground
drip system with a riser at each plant. During the second and third years, waterings are less frequent but of longer duration. This method trains the plants to keep going deeper for their water, helping them establish root systems that will be
able to tap the large belowground soil moisture reserve. After the third year, the grapes are not irrigated at all—unless
exceptionally dry conditions require it, and even then the water used (no more than 40 gal/plant) is very modest compared
with conventional systems.

But dry farming is more than just the absence or limitation of irrigation. Plants must be spaced sufficiently to allow
each plant to obtain the moisture it needs from the soil. On the cobbly alluvial sandy loam soil of the ranch, a 10 ft × 10 ft
spacing is used for grapes and 20 ft × 20 ft for olives. This means that the plants are much less dense than in conventional
plantings, leading to a much lower per-acre yield of fruit.


**74** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems


Cultivation is the key process for moisture conservation. Soil cultivation is done as soon as the rains stop at the end of
the winter, and it is critical to do this while there is still moisture close to the surface and before evaporation causes much
loss. The first step is to mow the vetch/oat covercrop and any vine prunings on the ground. The next step is to disk with
a small conventional offset disk to incorporate the mowed organic matter. After letting the organic matter decompose
for about 2 weeks, a center split disk is used to break up the soil clods and pull soil back to the center of the rows away
from the plants where it was thrown by the first disking. (Interestingly, the few degrees of heat decomposition generates
during this time can provide a bit of protection from light late frosts.) The final and most important step in cultivation is
done with a harrow with three rows of implements: the first a set of spring sweeps, the second a row of spikes, and the
third a roller chopper (see Figure 6.6). This harrow leaves a **dust mulch**, a uniform 3–4 in. thick moisture-trapping layer
of dry soil. The word _dust_ is really a misnomer, since a true dust is highly susceptible to wind erosion. Proper cultivation
leaves a dry layer of soil with good crumb structure that resists the wind. The moisture conserving capacity of the dry
layer comes from the breaking of capillarity of the water column in the soil at the contact between the dry layer on top
of the moist soil below. If more rain occurs and capillarity is reestablished, the harrow is pulled through the vineyard
again right after the rain. No weeding needs to be done during the growing season, since all weeds are removed by the
spring cultivation.

Because the soil cultivation for moisture management requires cross cultivation in both directions along the plant
rows, the grapes cannot be trained in the cordon style on wires between plants in a row. Instead, the grapes are “head
trained” and free standing (Figure 6.6).

With rainfall variability, there is also yield variability. In a wet year, about 2 tons of grapes to the acre can be
harvested. But in a very dry year, yields might only be a third of that. The quality of the wine produced from the
grapes, though, is enhanced by dry farming. Grapes are not diluted by excess moisture so that full fruit flavors come
forward. In dry years, grapes are smaller, leading to more contact between juice and skin during fermentation. And
with the variability in rainfall from year to year, each vintage is a unique expression of the relationship between dry
farming, rainfall, and the vineyard. Olive harvests seem to be much less impacted by dry years, since well-established
olive trees have a much deeper and more extensive root system, and are hence more drought tolerant. As a means of
compensating for lower and more variable yields, Condor’s Hope sells the wine and olive oil produced from its small
5-acre planting directly to consumers at farmers’ markets in Santa Cruz, CA, and through a wine club, where a fairer
price is obtained for both the farmer and the buyer. Through these direct transactions, the grower can share the story
of the dry farm system.

soil. Tomatoes seem to be a crop that is particularly well suited
to this system. Tomato seedlings are planted deeply into moist
soil in May, with no irrigation applied. Cultivation of the soil
surface maintains a weed-free dust mulch, and because the soil
surface is dry and no rain occurs during the growing season,
the plants are not staked or tied, and fungal disease is a minor
problem. Harvest begins in late August and continues until
the first rains of the new wet season, usually in late October or
early November. Tomatoes harvested from this system have a
reputation for more concentrated flavor (Figure 6.5).



The sustainability of dry farming systems must be
weighed against the potential loss of soil organic matter from
the upper soil levels with the dust mulch system, the danger
of soil erosion from wind and rain because of the low level of

soil cover, and the unpredictability of soil moisture availability as a result of variable rainfall during the fallow period.
But as a way of farming in areas with low and unpredictable
rainfall, dry farming can be a low-external-input alternative.

In warm regions of the world with arid climates (less than
250 mm annual precipitation), lack of rainfall is a severe limiting factor for agriculture. In many such places, however,
rainfall does occur with some regularity in the form of short,
torrential showers, and it is possible to “harvest” this water
by collecting and concentrating rainfall runoff.

In the Negev desert of Israel, once-abandoned systems
of small catchment runoff farms have been reconstructed

and made to produce crop yields equivalent to those of irrigated farms in the same region (Evenari 1982). The farm unit
consists of catchment areas for rainfall on the slopes of the
watershed surrounding flattened drainage channels where
runoff is collected. Low rock walls channel rain runoff down
into the small floodplain of the channels. This system can
collect 20%–40% of the rainfall that occurs, and removing
loose rock from the soil surface on the hillsides can increase

runoff collection to as much as 60%. Small rock check dams

in the larger channels at the bottom of the slopes concentrate runoff to a depth sufficient to allow water to penetrate
to approximately 2 m into the soil, after which the soil dries
and leaves a crust relatively impervious to evaporative water
loss. As each check dam fills, it spills over into others below,
watering a complex system of floodplain farm plots. Crop
yields of grains such as barley and wheat, and fruits such as
almonds, apricots, and grapes, are quite respectable for such
an arid region. Rather than attempting to create large reservoirs of water that would mostly evaporate in such a climate
(and accumulate nutrient-rich sediments), both water and
nutrient-rich sediments are stored on-site in the water harvest

system (Figure 6.7).

A similar system still is used in the arid American
Southwest, where native American groups such as the Hopi
and Papago have been practicing a form of water harvesting
for many centuries. The flow from heavy convective rainfall
in the mountains during the summer is diverted over alluvial
fans as a shallow sheet of runoff, rather than being allowed



**FIGURE 6.7** **Fruit and olive trees in the Negev Desert near**
**Avdat in Israel.** Rainwater is harvested from the surrounding hillsides to provide soil moisture for the orchard.


to concentrate in a stream channel. This sheet of water then

“irrigates” annual crops of corn, beans, squash, and other
local crops. The upper watershed is not manipulated as in
the Negev system, but similar manipulation of runoff on the
floodplain below takes place. The goals of both agroecosystems are to work within the constraints and limits of the
natural rainfall regime.


**G** **razing** **S** **ystems**


In regions where rainfall is both limited and highly unpredictable, natural vegetation is made up of a mixture of waterseeking, drought-resistant shrubs and perennial grasses, as
well as annual species that can germinate and complete their
life cycles in the short period that water is available. The
drought tolerance of the perennials is combined with the
drought avoidance of the annuals to form a system that can
produce biomass during most of the year. In many parts of
the world, this type of ecosystem is associated with extensive populations of native grazing animals. When we consider the ability of grazing animals to move in search of
adequate forage, such ecosystems reflect considerable adaptability and diversity.

Many managed grazing systems take advantage of the
ability of pasture or range ecosystems to maintain production
of biomass in the face of low and highly variable rainfall. In
most cases, natural range is managed with specific stocking
rates and timing to adjust to the natural dynamics of plant
growth in response to rainfall. Animals are moved from one
part of a range to another during the year as forage availability shifts. In other cases, such range is improved with the
introduction of drought-tolerant forage species that are very
successful under drier conditions.


In a world in which increasing consumption of animal
products and ecologically inefficient and degrading methods of raising livestock represent some of the most serious threats to the integrity and long-term productivity of

our food systems, many traditional and managed grazing
systems in low-rainfall regions stand as good examples of
sustainable animal-based food production. We will discuss
grazing systems in more detail in this context and others in
Chapter 19.

Since the beginning of agriculture thousands of years ago,
the managers of rainfed agroecosystems have had to cope
with the vagaries of precipitation. Sometimes the rains are
late, and sometimes they never come. Droughts can last years
and even decades. Occasionally too much rain falls during
a short period, flooding fields, damaging crops, and washing away the soil or making it unworkable. Climatologists
and atmospheric scientists are predicting that climate change
will almost certainly make these challenges even more difficult. Precipitation will become more variable and more
unpredictable in the coming decades. The extremes of precipitation—droughts and high-rainfall events—are likely to
become more frequent, and droughts will probably be deeper
and longer lasting.

In a world in which drought is more common and rainfall less predictable, it might seem that in the more arid
regions rainfed agroecosystems will be at greater risk than
those that have exploited other sources of water through
infrastructures of irrigation. This may be true on a shortterm basis, but over the long term rainfed agroecosystems
will prove more sustainable because their design rests on
the assumption that rainfall can be fickle and that agroecosystems must accommodate themselves to this reality rather
than the other way around. Many agroecosystems that are
dependent on irrigation, in contrast, may find that the water
they use is subject to increasing demand and competition from nonagricultural users while at the same time it
becomes increasingly scarce and costly. The source of much
of the world’s irrigation water is snow, and the total mass of
snow deposited in the world’s mountain ranges each winter
is predicted to shrink considerably in the coming decades.
Similarly, the water stored underground in deep aquifers
is generally being used much faster than it is replenished
through recharge, and rates of groundwater recharge will
in most areas of the world diminish over time as well. So,
while adapting to increased variability of precipitation will
be a challenge, the alternative—attempting to avoid the
problem temporarily through irrigation—will only make
matters worse in the long run.


**L** **essons** **from** **S** **ustainable** **S** **ystems**


Much of present-day agricultural development has appro­
ached the lack or excess of rainfall intent upon eliminating or altering conditions to fit the needs of the cropping
systems being introduced. This usually involves high levels
of external inputs of energy or materials. Irrigated systems,
of course, are the preeminent example of this approach.



As we will see in Chapter 9, the irrigation technologies that
have been deployed all over the world to compensate for
low rainfall and to increase production have a great many
ecological consequences, including soil erosion, sedimentation, salinization, damage to watershed systems, and
depletion of aquifers. At the other end of the precipitation
spectrum, there are many examples of drainage projects—
some of them massive—that have also attempted to alter
existing ecological conditions and have achieved only
limited or mixed success when evaluated in terms of crop
productivity, economic viability, and social welfare (e.g.,
Candiani 2014).

What irrigated systems and drainage projects share in
common is unsustainability. The extreme and large-scale
manipulation of hydrological regimes entailed by both
approaches is damaging to natural systems and requires
both energy subsidies and large physical inputs. Moreover,
many irrigation systems depend on using groundwater faster
than it can be replenished, and some of the land “reclaimed”
through drainage is threatened by the rise in sea levels that
will occur through this century and beyond.

By examining the nature of humidity and rainfall as we
have done in this chapter, and by learning from the examples of agroecosystems that work with local rainfall conditions rather than against them, we can better understand
how to produce food without putting additional pressure
on that most precious of natural resources—water. With
population growth, increases in civic and industrial water
consumption, reductions in mountain snowfall brought
about by climate change, and the increasing likelihood
of widespread and long-term drought in many parts of
the world, the availability of freshwater is likely to be the
premier challenge for human society in the decades ahead
(Kumar 2013). We can ill afford, therefore, to keep so much
of the world’s food production dependent on using enormous quantities of water. We need to intensify the search
for ways to accommodate agriculture to variable, unpredictable, and frequently limited rainfall. The examples of
rainfed agriculture presented in this chapter are an excellent place to start.
