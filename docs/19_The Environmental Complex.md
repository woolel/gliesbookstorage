## 12. The Environmental Complex

The previous chapters have examined the separate influences of individual environmental factors on the crop plant.
The chapters in Section II looked at the abiotic factors of the
environment—light, temperature, precipitation, wind, soil,
soil moisture, and fire—and then Chapter 11 added other
organisms to the suite of factors we must be aware of when
considering the effect of the environment on crop plants.
Although it is important to understand the impact that each
of these factors has by itself, rarely does any factor operate
alone or in a consistent manner on the organism. Moreover,
all of the factors that have been discussed as separate components of the environment also interact with and affect
each other. Therefore, the environment in which an individual organism occurs needs to be understood as a dynamic,
ever-changing composite of all the interacting environmental factors—that is, as an **environmental complex** .

When all of the factors that confront a crop plant are considered together, it is possible to examine characteristics of
the environment that emerge only from the interaction of
these factors. These characteristics—which include com
plexity, heterogeneity, and dynamic change—are the main
topics of this chapter. Their examination in terms of their
impact on the crop plant represents an important step in analyzing agroecosystems autecologically.


**THE ENVIRONMENT AS A COMPLEX**

**OF FACTORS**


The environment in which a plant grows can be defined as
the sum of all external forces and factors, both biotic and
abiotic, that affect the growth, structure, and reproduction of
that plant. In agroecosystems, it is vital to understand which
factors in this environment—due to their condition or level

at the time—might be limiting a plant, and to know what
levels of certain factors are necessary for optimum performance. Agroecosystem design and management are based
largely on such information. The foundations of this understanding have been presented in the earlier chapters of this
book. Individual factors have been explored, and many agricultural options for their management have been reviewed.
Since the environment is a complex of all of these factors,
it becomes just as important to understand how each factor
affects or is affected by others, singly or in complex combinations that vary in time and place. It is the complex interactions of factors that make up the total environment of the
crop organism.



**F** **actoring** **the** **E** **nvironment**


The concept of an environmental complex is presented schematically in Figure 12.1. Although lines representing connections have not been drawn, the figure is intended to show
that interactions occur between factors themselves, as well
as between each factor and the crop organism. The component factors of the environment discussed in the previous
chapters are all included, as well as several others. Since it
is impossible to divide the entire environment neatly into
components, or to include every possible factor, the factors
shown in Figure 12.1 involve some simplification and overlap. Furthermore, each of the factors is not of equal importance at any particular time. For this reason, time is not listed
as an independent factor, but should instead be considered as
the background context within which the entire complex of
factors is changing.

Because of the complexity of the environment, it is clear
that its factors can combine to affect organisms in the environment in addition to doing so independently. Factors can
work together simultaneously and synergistically to affect
an organism, or they can make their effects felt through a
cascade of changes in other factors. An example of such factor interaction is the lush weed growth on the north-facing
side of the furrow illustrated in Figure 4.4. In this particular microclimatic site, lower temperatures, higher moisture, higher biological activity, and possibly higher nutrient
availability were simultaneously associated with the small
amount of shading that occurred, and this combination of
factors effectively altered the conditions for plant growth.
As another example, an allelopathic compound released
from the roots of a crop can interact with shading, moisture
stress, herbivory, susceptibility to disease, and other factors
to either enhance or reduce the effectiveness of the phytotoxic compound in limiting weed growth in a cropping system. Because of such interactions, it is often a challenge to
predict the consequences of any single modification of the

agroecosystem.

One of the weaknesses of the conventional agronomic
approach to managing agroecosystems is that it ignores factor interactions and environmental complexity. The needs of
the crop are considered in terms of isolated, individual factors, and then each factor is managed separately to achieve
maximum yield. Agroecological management, in contrast,
begins with the farm system as a whole and designs interventions according to how they will impact the whole system,

**FIGURE 12.1** **Representation of the environmental complex.**
The environment of an individual crop plant is made up of many
interacting factors. Although the environment’s level of complexity is high, most of the factors that make it up can be managed.
Recognizing factor interactions and the overall complexity of
the environment is the first step toward sustainable management.

not just crop yield. Interventions may be intended to modify
single factors, but the potential impact on other factors is
always considered as well.


**C** **omplexity** **of** **I** **nteraction**


The way in which a complex of factors interacts to impact
a plant can be illustrated by seed germination and the **safe**
**site** concept of Harper (1977). We know from ecophysiological studies that an individual seed germinates in response
to a precise set of conditions it encounters in its immediate environment. The locality at the scale of the seed that
provides these conditions has been termed the “safe site.”
A safe site provides the exact requirements of an individual
seed for the breaking of dormancy, and for the processes
of germination to take place. In addition, there must be
freedom from hazards such as diseases, herbivory, or toxic
substances. The conditions of the safe site must endure

until the seedling becomes independent of the original seed
reserves. The requirements of the seed during this time
change, and so the limits of what constitutes a safe site must
also change.

Figure 12.2 describes some of the environmental factors that influence the germination of a seed and make up
the “safe site.” Factors immediately surrounding the seed
are what influence the seed most directly. Factors around
the outside perimeter of the diagram are factors and



variables that influence the effect, degree, or presence of
the direct factors.


**HETEROGENEITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT**


The environment of any individual plant varies not only
in space but also in time. The intensity of each factor in
Figure 12.1 shows variation from place to place through time,
with an average for each factor setting the parameters of the
habitat within which each plant is adapted. When variation in
a factor exceeds the limits of tolerance of a plant, the effects
can be very damaging. Farming systems that take this variation into account are much more likely to have a positive outcome for the farmer.


**S** **patial** **H** **eterogeneity**


The habitat in which a plant occurs is the space characterized by particular combinations of factor intensities that
vary both horizontally and vertically. Even in a field planted
to a single variety of grain crop, for example, each plant
will encounter slightly different conditions because of spatial variation in factors such as soil, moisture, temperature,
and nutrient levels. The amount of variation in these factors

will depend upon the extent to which the farmer tries to
create uniformity in that field with equipment, irrigation,
fertilizers, or other inputs. Regardless of these attempts,
however, there will be slight variation in topography, exposure, soil cover, and so on that will create microenvironmental differences across the space of the field. Very small
variations in microhabitat, in turn, can bring about shifts in

crop response.

In a wet tropical lowland environment, for example,
where soils are poorly drained and rainfall is high, slight
topographic variation can make a big difference in soil moisture and drainage. In such an area, the lower-lying areas of a
field may be subject to much more waterlogging than the rest
of the field, and crop plants growing there may experience
arrested root development and poorer performance, as illustrated in Figure 9.3. Some farmers in the region of Tabasco,
Mexico, where the photograph in Figure 9.3 was taken, plant
waterlogging-tolerant crops, such as rice or local varieties
of taro ( _Colocasia_ spp. or _Xanthosoma_ spp.), in the lowerlying areas of their farms as a way of making a better match
between crop requirements and field conditions. Finding
ways to take advantage of the spatial heterogeneity of conditions by adjusting crop types and arrangements is often more
ecologically efficient than trying to enforce homogeneity or
ignore heterogeneity.

In multiple cropping systems, variation in the vertical
dimension must also be taken into account because one crop
or canopy layer will generally create strata of varying conditions for other crops or canopy layers. This is especially
true if a new crop is being planted into an already established canopy, such as into an agroforestry or tree-dominated
home garden agroecosystem. To complicate matters even

**FIGURE 12.2** **Environmental factors affecting seed germination.** Factors immediately surrounding the seed affect it most directly;
factors in the outer perimeter mostly affect the intensity, level, and presence of the direct factors. The importance of each factor will vary
depending on the species of the seed.



more, a large mature plant member of such a system is occupying a range of microhabitats simultaneously. Which portion of the habitat and combination of microenvironmental

conditions are affecting the organism the most?

Because of the difficulty involved in creating absolutely
uniform conditions in farm fields, especially in resourcelimited or small-scale traditional agroecosystems, farmers
often plant multiple species or a variety of crop mixtures,
with the idea that a diverse combination of crops with a
range of adaptations will do better in a variable environment
(Vandermeer 1992). It is a real challenge in experimental
agronomic studies to adequately take such variability into
account. High-standard deviations don’t necessarily mean
that something was wrong with the research methodology. It
may just mean that the sample area was extremely variable!



**D** **ynamic** **C** **hange**


Since the combination of factors in any environment is constantly changing through time, a farmer must also take into
account temporal heterogeneity. Changes take place hourly,
daily, seasonally, yearly, and even as part of longer-term climatic shifts. Some of this change is cumulative and some
of it is cyclic. For any particular factor, there is a need to
be aware of how rapidly its intensity can change over time,
and how the changes can affect a particular crop organism,
based on its length of exposure and its limits of tolerance.
At the same time, each crop organism, as it goes through its
life cycle, will undergo shifts both in the way it responds
to different factor intensities and in its tolerance for those

intensities.


**146** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



A crop plant, for example, experiences a continually
changing environment as it progresses through its life cycle.
If a factor or combination of factors reaches some critical

level at the same time the plant reaches some particularly
sensitive stage in its life cycle, suppression of further development can occur and result in a crop failure. Germination,
initial seedling growth, flowering, and fruiting are the stages
during which extreme or unusual variation in environmental
factors is most likely to impact crop performance. As was
seen in Figure 9.4, for example, a period of waterlogging during the growth of cowpeas had a negative effect on yield, but
the nature and extent of this effect depended on when the
waterlogging occurred.

Because of dynamic change, interventions in the field
often need to be carefully timed. For example, a farmer wanting to use a propane-fired burner (described in Chapter 10)
to kill weed seedlings is limited to a small window of time
in the early stages of development of the crop. If the crop is
too small and delicate, flaming can kill the crop seedlings
along with the weed seedlings. If the crop is too tall, it might
be difficult to avoid damaging the plants with the flaming
apparatus itself. The effective window for using flame weeders might be as short as 4 or 5 days in delicate crops such
as carrots or onions, both of which have little ability to deal
with interference from weeds on their own.


**INTERACTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS**


Each of the many factors that make up the environmental complex has the potential to interact with other factors
and thereby modify, accentuate, or mitigate their affects on
organisms. The interaction of factors can have both positive
and negative consequences in agroecosystems.


**C** **ompensating** **F** **actors**


When one factor overcomes or eliminates the impact of
another, then it is referred to as a **compensating factor** . When
a crop is growing under conditions that would otherwise be
limiting for its successful growth or development, one or
more factors may be compensating for the limiting factor.

The effect of a compensating factor is commonly seen in
fertilization trials, when a particular soil nutrient (e.g., nitrogen) is limiting as determined by the plant response. Reduced
growth and lower yields are signs of the deficiency. But rather
than simply adding more of the deficient nutrient, it is sometimes possible to alter some other factor of the environment
that renders more of the “limited” nutrient available to plants.
In the case of nitrogen deficiency, it may be that poor soil
drainage is restricting nitrogen uptake by roots, so that once
soil drainage is improved, the lack of nitrogen uptake is compensated for.

Another case of compensation for a limiting factor occurs
when a farmer counters the negative impact of a leaf-eating
herbivore by stimulating more luxurious or rapid growth of
the affected crop through an intervention such as adding



compost to the soil or applying a foliar fertilizer. The added
biomass can allow the crop to carry the herbivore load and
still produce a successful harvest. The added plant growth
compensates for herbivory.

In coastal regions where fog is common during the dry
summer season (e.g., the Mediterranean maritime region of
coastal California), the fog can compensate for the lack of
rainfall. This occurs through the reduction in transpirational
water loss, and the lower evaporative stress due to less direct
sunlight and lower temperatures. The leafy vegetable crops
common in the lower Salinas and Pajaro Valleys of California
could probably not be grown profitably during the middle of
the summer without such compensation, because these crops
are subject to considerable water loss through transpiration
on hot days.


**M** **ultiplicity** **of** **F** **actors**


When several factors are closely related, it may be particularly difficult to separate the effect of one factor from
another. The factors can act as a functional unit, either simultaneously or in a chainlike manner. One factor influences or
accentuates another, which then affects a third; but in terms
of crop response, where one factor stops and another takes
over is impossible to determine. The factors of temperature,
light, and soil moisture often function in such a closely interrelated manner. For a corn crop in an open field, for example,
increasing light levels during the morning increase temperature, and the higher temperature increases evaporation of
water from the soil while transpiration also increases. Thus
the intensity of each factor varies simultaneously with every
change in the intensity of solar radiation, and the relative
effect of each factor on the crop is practically inseparable
from the multiplicity of effects they have together. As the
climate warms and dries in many areas of the world, the particular forms of interaction among these three factors will be
of increasing concern.


**F** **actor** **P** **redisposition**


A particular environmental factor may cause a crop response
that renders the crop more susceptible to damage by another
factor. In such cases, the first factor is said to predispose
the plant to the effects of the second factor. Low light levels
caused by shading, for example, can predispose a plant to
fungal attack. The lower light levels usually mean higher
relative humidity for the plant and cause it to develop thinner, larger leaves that then may be more susceptible to attack
by a pathogenic fungus that occurs more commonly when
excess moisture is present in the environment. Similarly,
research has shown that some crop plants are more susceptible to herbivore damage when they have been given large
amounts of nitrogenous fertilizer. The plant tissue is predisposed to the herbivory due to its higher nitrogen content—
apparently the nitrogen serves as an attractant for the pest
(Chen et al. 2008).


The Environmental Complex **147**



**MANAGING COMPLEXITY**


Sustainable agroecosystem management will require an
understanding not only of how individual factors affect crop
organisms but also of how all factors interact to form the
environmental complex. Part of this understanding comes
from knowing how factors interact with, compensate for,
enhance, and even counteract each other. Another part
comes from knowing the extent of variability present on the
farm, from field to field and within each field. Conditions
vary from one season to another, as well as from 1 year to the
next. From climate to soils, from abiotic to biotic factors, and
from plants to animals, factors interact and vary in dynamic
and ever-changing patterns. An important component of sustainability is knowing not only the extent and form of factor
interaction, but also the range of variability in interactions
that can occur over time. Adapting the agroecosystem as
much as possible to take advantage of complexity and variability where appropriate, and to compensate for both when
not, is in many ways the challenge that will be addressed in
the following chapters.


**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**


1. What factors may have impacted seed before a

farmer buys it for planting? How may these influences affect the performance of the seed once it is
planted?
2. What are some ways that a farmer can manage an

agroecosystem in a highly variable environment
other than trying to control or homogenize the conditions that create the heterogeneity?
3. What are some of the disadvantages for a farmer

who chooses to deal with or adapt to (rather than
overcome) spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the
agroecosystem?
4. What are some ways that a farmer can successfully

compensate for a limiting factor by altering or managing one or several other factors, and thus contribute to the sustainability of a farming system?
