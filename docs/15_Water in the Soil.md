## chapter 9. Water in the Soil

Water is continually flowing through the body of a plant: leaving the stomata via transpiration and entering through the roots. For this reason, plants depend on having a certain amount of water available to their roots in the soil. Without

adequate soil moisture, they quickly wilt and die. Thus maintaining sufficient moisture in the _rhizosphere_ —the part of the soil infiltrated by plant roots—is a crucial part of agro ecosystem management.

Yet soil moisture management is not simply a matter of there being adequate inputs of water into the soil from precipitation or irrigation. Soil moisture is part of the ecology of the soil and of the whole agroecosystem. Not only is water availability and retention affected by a myriad of factors, but water itself plays many roles. It carries soluble nutrients, affects soil aeration and temperature, and impacts soil biotic processes. Many members of the soil microfauna, such as nematodes and protozoa, are essentially aquatic and live within the thin film of water adhering to soil particles. Further, plants themselves affect the distribution and availability of soil moisture. A farmer, therefore, must be aware of how water acts in the soil, how water levels in the soil are affected by weather conditions and cropping practices, how inputs of water affect soil moisture, and what the water needs of the crop are.

Rarely is the moisture availability of a soil exactly optimum for a crop for a very long period of time. Water supply varies between deficiency and surplus from day to day and throughout the season. The actual optimum is hard to determine, since it is affected by a range of other factors, and conditions are constantly changing. But we do know a lot about the range of moisture conditions that promote the highest yields for most crops. The challenge is to manage water in the soil in ways that keep conditions within this range.

**MOVEMENT OF WATER IN THE SOIL**

In natural ecosystems, water enters the system as rainfall or snowmelt at the surface of the soil. In agroecosystems, water enters from the same sources, as described in Chapter 6, or is added as irrigation. Sustainable management of soil moisture depends greatly on understanding the fate of this applied water, with a goal of maximizing efficiency of water use by the system.

**I** **nfiltration**

For the water falling on or applied to the soil surface to become available to plants, it must infiltrate into the soil.

Infiltration is by no means a given: water can be lost to surface runoff or even evaporation if it cannot penetrate the soil surface easily. Infiltration is affected by soil type, slope, vegetative cover, and characteristics of the precipitation itself. Soils with greater porosity, such as sandy soils or those with high organic matter content, are more open to the easy infiltration of water. Flat terrain is more apt to allow better infiltration than sloping ground, and a smooth slope loses more water to runoff than one that is broken by microtopographic variation caused by rocks, soil clumps, slight depressions, or other obstructions on the surface. Vegetative cover, both alive and as litter on the surface, greatly aids initial water entry. In general, assuming optimal conditions, the greater the intensity of rainfall, the greater the infiltration rate until saturation is achieved. However, with excessively intense rainfall, increased runoff will occur.

**P** **ercolation**

Once saturation of the upper layers of the soil occurs, gravitational forces begin to pull the excess water more deeply into the soil profile. This process, known as **percolation**, is shown in Figure 9.1. The rate of percolation is determined by soil structure, texture, and porosity. A soil with good crumb structure and aggregate stability will allow water to move freely between soil particles. Sandy textured soils have larger pore spaces and less soil particle surface area to hold water than more finely textured soils, and will therefore allow the most rapid movement of water. A soil that is very high in clay content may allow rapid percolation initially, but once the clay micelles swell with water, they may close the pore spaces and impede movement. Root channels and animal burrows, especially those of earthworms, are important pathways for percolation, but soil texture and structure are probably of greater importance, especially in frequently cultivated

agroecosystems.

**E** **vaporation**

Once moisture enters the soil, it can be lost to the atmosphere through evaporation. The rate of evaporation from the soil surface depends on the moisture content and temperature of the atmosphere above the surface, as well as the temperature of the soil surface itself. Wind greatly accelerates the evaporation process, especially at higher temperatures.

Even though evaporation occurs at the surface, it can affect soil moisture deep into the soil profile. As evaporation creates a water deficit at the soil surface, the attractive forces

**FIGURE 9.1** **Movement of water in the soil of a cropping system.** (a) Water infiltrates the surface after falling as precipitation. (b) Gravitational water percolates downward, leaving the soil above moistened to field capacity with capillary water. At the same time, evaporation and transpiration begin to remove water from the soil. (c) As gravitational water continues to percolate downward, the soil near the surface begins to dry out. (d) When the gravitational water reaches the water table, most of the soil profile is moistened close to field capacity. The exception is the upper layer of soil, which has dried out from evaporation. (e) Most of the soil above the capillary fringe, the region kept moist by the water table, has dried out, and the soil once more nears the wilting point.

between water molecules draw water from below through capillary action. This process continues until the saturated zone reaches too deep or the upper soil layer becomes so dry that capillarity is broken. Any kind of mulch or soil surface cover that slows the heat gain of the soil surface and presents a barrier between the soil and the atmosphere will slow the rate of evaporation.

**T** **ranspiration**

As described in Chapter 3, plants lose water through the stomata in the leaves as transpired moisture, creating a water deficit in the plant that is balanced by uptake of water by the plant roots. This biotic removal of water from the soil, especially by roots that penetrate the soil layers below those affected by evaporation, constitutes a major avenue of water movement out of the soil ecosystem. If water is not added to replace this loss, plants either have to go dormant or are eliminated from the ecosystem.

**H** **ydraulic** **R** **edistribution**

The same physical principles responsible for transpiration allow some plants to move water through their root tissues when their stomata are closed and thereby transport water from one part of the rhizosphere to another. This special

ability is possessed by shrubs and trees with xylem pathways that run from their shallow lateral roots to their deeper taproots. When one part of the plant’s root system lies in an area of very dry soil, water is drawn out of those roots by the high water potential, exerting a force, or pressure potential, analogous to that of transpirational pull. This pressure potential pulls water from roots located in wetter soil. The water moves through the plant’s root system and exudes from the roots in the drier soil, effectively moistening that soil. This movement of water, called hydraulic (or hydrologic) redistribution, occurs mostly at night, when the plant’s stomata are closed and transpiration is not competing for the water in the wetter parts of the rhizosphere.

In the form of hydraulic redistribution with greatest relevance for agriculture, called _hydraulic lifting_, water is drawn from the deep layers of the soil penetrated by the plant’s long taproots and redistributed to the soil near the surface occupied by the lateral roots. Although hydraulic lifting is not known to occur in any of the annual plants from which humans derive most of their food, it does have relevance for agroecosystems (Liste and White 2008). In semiarid regions with alternating wet–dry seasons, crop plants can be grown in association with native trees or shrubs that exhibit hydraulic lifting. In such systems, the moisture brought to the surface by the shrubs or trees can greatly increase the yield of the crop plants or even spell the difference between crop success and failure.

Water in the Soil **107**

**SOIL MOISTURE AVAILABILITY**

The attractive forces operating between water and individual soil particles play a key role in determining how soil moisture is retained, lost, and used by plants. Understanding these forces means looking at the physical and chemical properties of the **soil solution**, the liquid phase of the soil and its dissolved solutes that are separate from the soil particles themselves.

The percentage of moisture available for plant use in a soil has traditionally been determined by collecting a soil sample, measuring its weight, drying the soil at 105°C for 24 h, and then measuring its dry weight. The amount of moisture lost during drying is divided by the sample dry weight, giving a figure that is expressed as a percentage.

This procedure, however, is not adequate for measuring the amount of water actually available to plants in the soil because it does not take into account the important variable of water adhesion to soil particles. As both clay and organic matter content increase in a soil, water is attracted more tightly to soil particles and becomes more difficult for roots to take up. Lettuce may wilt, for example, in a clay soil with 15% moisture, whereas in a sandy soil, moisture may drop as low as 6% before the crop will wilt.

Because water is held more tightly in some kinds of soil compared to others, another measure besides just percent moisture content is needed that better reflects the attractive force between soil particles and moisture. This measure is achieved by expressing soil moisture in energy terms. The force of attraction of water molecules to soil particles, the soil water potential, is expressed as bars of suction, where 1 bar is equivalent to standard atmospheric pressure at sea level (760 mm Hg or 1020 cm of water). This method provides a means of measuring the availability of water in the soil solution and takes into account the varying forces of attraction determined by soil particle size and organic matter content.

A number of special terms are used to describe water moisture content and availability in terms of attractive forces. These are defined in the following and illustrated in Figure 9.2.

- **Gravitational water** is water that moves into,

through, and out of the soil under the influence of gravity alone. Immediately following rain or irrigation this water begins to move downward into the soil, occupying all macropore spaces.

- **Capillary water** is the water that fills the micro pores of the soil and is held to particles with a force between 0.3 and 31 bars of suction.

- **Hygroscopic water** is the water held most tightly to

soil particles, usually with more than 31 bars of suction. After soil has been oven-dried, the remaining nonchemically bound water is hygroscopic water.

- **Water of hydration** is the water that is chemically

bound with the soil particles.

- **Easily available water** is the portion of the

water in the soil that is readily absorbed by plant

**FIGURE 9.2** **Soil moisture in relation to force of attraction**

**to soil particles.** Permanent wilting point is reached when easily available water has been depleted. Field capacity is the amount of water remaining after gravitational water has drained away.

roots—usually capillary water between 0.3 and 15 bars of suction.

- **Field capacity** is the moisture left in the soil after

the downward pull of gravity has drained the macropores of gravitational water, leaving the micropores filled with capillary water held with at least 0.3 bars of suction to soil particles.

- **Permanent wilting point** is the moisture content of

the soil at which a plant wilts and does not recover even when placed in a dark, humid environment. Permanent wilting point usually occurs when all the capillary water held at less than 15 bars of suction has been removed from the soil.

Since every soil is a different mixture of particle sizes and is variable in organic matter content, and because these characteristics determine water retention ability, it is important to determine the soil type as a part of developing a water management plan. In most soils, optimum growth takes place when soil moisture content is kept just below field capacity. It is clear that the moisture needed for optimum growth does not extend over the complete range of soil moisture content.

**PLANTS’ UPTAKE OF SOIL MOISTURE**

While they are transpiring, plants must continually replace the significant amount of water they lose through their stomata. At any one time, however, only a small proportion of available soil water is close enough to the root surfaces that actually absorb the water. Two processes compensate for this limitation. First, water is drawn passively through the soil to root surfaces through capillary movement of water, and second, plant roots actively grow into the soil toward areas with sufficient moisture for uptake.

**108** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

**C** **apillary** **M** **ovement** **of** **W** **ater**

As a plant takes in water through its roots to replace that which it loses through transpiration, the soil moisture content of the area immediately surrounding the root is reduced. This increases the energy of suction in that region, creating a gradient of lower water potential that tends to draw moisture in all directions from the surrounding soil. Typically, most water is drawn from deeper in the soil profile, especially when the water table is close to the surface. Capillary movement is due partly to the attraction of water molecules to soil particle surfaces, and partly to the attraction of water molecules to each other. The speed at which capillary movement occurs depends on the intensity of the water deficit and the type of soil. In most sandy soils, movement is fairly rapid because the larger-sized particles hold water less tightly. In soils with more clay, especially those with poor crumb structure, movement is much slower.

It has been shown that water can move only a few centimeters a day through capillary action. But due to the extensive volume of soil occupied by most root systems, movement of any greater distance is probably not needed. Plants can obtain a large proportion of their water needs through capillary movement even when transpiration rates are very high. The increased suction pressure created in the immediate root zone during the day is replaced by water movement through the soil from areas of lower suction during the night. It is at times when soil moisture content has been severely depleted and plant growth has slowed that such movement is of greatest significance. If inadequate moisture is present in the surrounding soil, the plant reaches the permanent wilting point.

**E** **xtension** **of** **R** **oots** **into** **the** **S** **oil**

Plants are continually extending roots into the soil, ensuring that new sites of root contact with the soil are being established. Roots, rootlets, and root hairs all combine to produce an extensive network of soil–root interface. Despite continued root penetration and the large volume of the root network, however, the total amount of any particular soil volume that is in contact with a plant’s roots at any one time is very small. According to most estimates, less than 1% of the total soil particle surface area within the volume of soil occupied by a plant’s roots is actually in contact with root surfaces. This fact underlines the importance of capillary movement of water and the complementarity of water movement and root extension.

Most annual plants distribute most of their roots in the upper 25–30 cm of the soil, and as a result, absorb most of their water from that horizon. Many perennial plants, such as grapes and fruit trees, have roots that extend much more deeply and are able to pull moisture from deeper in the soil profile. But even these plants probably rely heavily on water that is absorbed by roots in the upper horizons when it is available—the usual situation during the cropping cycle. When water is not sufficient, even annual plants such as squash and corn will rely on their deeper roots in an attempt to replace transpirational losses.

The relationship between soil moisture and plants’ water needs is the result of a complex interaction between soil conditions, rainfall or irrigation regimes, and the needs of the crop. Farmers try to maintain a balance between these components during the cropping season, but oftentimes events or conditions occur that shift the balance toward an excess of soil moisture or a deficiency.

**EXCESS WATER IN THE SOIL**

When excess water is present in an agroecosystem for an extended period of time, or movement of excess water out of the system is impeded, the condition known as waterlogging can occur. High rainfall, poor irrigation management, unfavorable topography, and poor surface drainage can bring about waterlogging and associated changes in the soil ecosystem. Waterlogged soils occur throughout the world, ranging from riverbank sediments to marshes, swamps, and peat bogs. Even well-drained soils can experience periods of waterlogging if they are subject to seasonal flooding (Figure 9.3).

Waterlogging occurs frequently and broadly enough that agricultural systems around the world have developed ways of dealing with excess water. More recently, this has involved the construction of costly draining and damming infrastructures. Simpler and traditional techniques, in contrast, have the goal of working with the condition of excess water rather than getting rid of it. In many wet areas of the world, for example, rice is cultivated as a crop ideally suited to wetland agriculture.

**N** **egative** **E** **ffects** **of** **E** **xcess** **W** **ater**

In a soil where air fills the pore spaces between soil particles, oxygen diffusion is rapid and there is rarely a deficiency of O 2 for ecological process (i.e., root metabolism and decomposer activity). But when the pores are filled or saturated with water, the diffusion rate of O 2 is greatly reduced.

**FIGURE 9.3** **Corn damaged by waterlogging in Tabasco,** **Mexico.** Excess soil moisture creates conditions that can stunt or

even kill a crop.

Water in the Soil **109**

Oxygen movement in saturated soil can be one-thousandth or less of what it is in well-aerated soil. Lack of O 2 can severely limit the respiration of root cells, allow populations of anaerobic microorganisms to build up, and establish chemically reducing conditions.

The depressed rates of gas exchange in waterlogged soils also allow the buildup of CO 2 and other gases. CO 2 accumulates wherever respiration is occurring, such as in the area of the roots, displacing needed oxygen and limiting many metabolic processes. Other gases begin to accumulate under the same conditions; for example, methane and ethylene can increase to toxic levels as a result of anaerobic breakdown

of organic matter. Phytotoxic water-soluble breakdown products of anaerobic organic matter decomposition also accumulate, a problem that has been noted even for rice production systems (Chou 1990).

Under conditions of limited O 2 supply, many soil microorganisms make use of electron acceptors other than oxygen for their respiratory oxidations. As a result, numerous compounds are converted into a state of chemical reduction, where oxygen is lost and hydrogen is gained. This in turn leads to imbalance in the oxidation–reduction (redox) potential of the soil, measured as the electrical potential of the soil to receive or supply electrons. Ferrous and manganous ions (rather than ferric or manganic) build up to toxic levels under reducing conditions.

Some anaerobic-tolerant microorganisms that can use nitrate as an oxygen source for respiration cause denitrification by liberating N 2 gas or toxic levels of nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Ammonia, too, can build up after flooding, but this is due more to the anaerobic breakdown of organic matter. In addition, anaerobic activity reduces sulfates to phytotoxic soluble sulfides, producing the familiar rotten-egg hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) smell.

Each of the conditions described earlier can become lim iting for plant development, either alone or in some combination. When a plant is weakened by these conditions it becomes more susceptible to diseases, especially in the root zone. The timing of flooding is also important. The susceptibility of a crop to negative effects from excess soil water conditions may depend on what stage of development the crop is in when the waterlogging occurs. The data in Figure 9.4 illustrate how waterlogging can affect crop growth, development, and yields in different ways depending on the timing of the waterlogging.

**D** **rainage** **S** **ystems**

Drainage systems have long been employed to make wetland areas more conducive to agriculture and simply to make cropping possible in the first place in areas with excess water or frequent flooding. Drainage systems involve constructing levees, canals, and ditch systems that either keep lowlying areas from being flooded (after the removal of water by pumping or evaporation) or permit the water table to be lowered so that the soil ecosystem can be kept aerobic.

Drainage systems are known to have been used by Roman and Chinese farmers more than 2000 years ago. Much of the Yangtze River Valley of China, the lowlands of the Netherlands, and the Delta region of California would not be farmable without complex drainage systems. More recently, stricter control of soil moisture has become possible with the development of subsurface drainage systems employing perforated plastic pipe that can be laid with special trenching machines.

But drainage systems are not without costs. Apart from the economic costs of installation and maintenance, drainage systems have ecological costs. The removed water carries

with it nutrients and sediments that are lost to the system and must be replaced. In areas of variable rainfall, excess drainage can cause increased drought damage during a dry year. In some regions with high evapotranspiration ( _ET_ ) during the growing season and where drains are used extensively, the disposal of the drainage water itself can be a problem, especially when it carries pesticide residues and high salt loads that can damage nearby natural ecosystems.

Instead of treating flooding as a problem to be solved with drainage systems or other infrastructures, it can be viewed as an opportunity for growing crops with adaptations that allow them to tolerate waterlogging. Rice ( _Oryza sativa_ ) is probably the most well-known example of such a crop. Originally an aquatic or swampland plant, rice has been cultivated as a crop that flourishes in wet habitats. Its adaptations include special air space tissue in the stems that allow air to diffuse to the roots, roots that can grow under conditions of low oxygen concentration, the ability to oxidize ferrous ions to reddish-brown ferric hydroxide in the rhizosphere and thus tolerate soils with high redox potential, and seeds that will germinate underwater due to their low oxygen requirement. Other crops are not completely wetland adapted, yet have adaptations that allow them to tolerate periodic flooding. Taro ( _Colocasia esculenta_ ), for example, may be able to tolerate flooding because of its ability to store oxygen in the swollen corm-like base of the leaves.

When an agroecological focus is applied to coping with excess water, an intermediate approach is often taken. Rather than trying to eliminate the water or restricting production to wet-adapted crops, topographic variation is created through various means to form beds, platforms, or fields with soils that lie above the water table or typical high water level.

In a traditional method employed in several regions around the world, soil is dug to build up raised beds, and in the process canals or ditches are formed (Figure 9.5). The canals serve to drain away excess water and to catch and retain erosional sediments and organic matter. In some cases, the canals also make possible fish production. If the system is installed in an area with an extended dry season, capillary movement of water upward from the water table can be sufficient to maintain crops, or irrigation water can be drawn from the nearby canal. Examples of such systems include the pond–dike systems of the Pearl River Delta of southern China and the canal–field systems of the Netherlands. Another example, the _camellone–zanja_ system of Tlaxcala, Mexico, was discussed in some detail in Chapter 6 as an adaptation to a local regime of wet-season flooding. Many of these agroecosystems have a very long history of successful management.

Another strategy used to create farmable soil in wetlands is to build up platforms in shallow lakebeds using rocks, soil, and cribbing materials from nearby areas and mounding

**FIGURE 9.5** **Constructing a raised-field farming system in** **a wetland in Tabasco, Mexico.** Soil dug from lateral ditches is being layered with waste sugarcane fiber to create a raised planting surface.

lakebed sediment and plant debris on top of these bases. An example of this type of system is the _chinampas_ developed during the pre-Hispanic era in the shallow lakes of the Valley of Mexico.

**SOIL WATER DEFICIENCY**

When the rate of moisture loss from a soil through _ET_ is greater than the input from rainfall or irrigation, plants begin to suffer. Evaporation depletes the water supply in the upper 15–25 cm of the soil, and depending on the rooting characteristics and transpiration rates of the plants in the soil, depletion can extend to a greater depth as plants lose water to the atmosphere through transpiration. As moisture is depleted from the soil, soil temperatures near the surface begin to rise, increasing even more the rate of evaporation. When the easily available water held to soil particles is depleted through these processes, levels of soil moisture may decline to the point where plants wilt temporarily during the day.

If temporary wilting consistently occurs, leaves begin to yellow, and growth and development are generally retarded. Leaves expand more slowly, are smaller, and age sooner. Photosynthetic rates drop in a stressed leaf, and a larger amount of assimilated photosynthate is stored in the plant roots. From a crop production point of view, such responses are negative since they result in a reduction in harvestable product. Moreover, when soil moisture is low enough for drought stress responses to occur repeatedly, crop failure may be the eventual result.

From an ecological perspective, drought stress responses may provide some adaptive advantage to the plant. For example, the allocation of more carbon to the roots of a waterstressed plant may promote more root growth, allowing the plant to draw moisture from a broader area. Water stress may force earlier flowering, fruiting, and seed formation, helping to ensure the survival of the species. In some cases, farmers can actually take advantage of such drought responses, as

Water in the Soil **111**

**ECOLOGY OF IRRIGATION**

In natural ecosystems, vegetation is adapted to the soil moisture regime set by climate and soil type. Agroecosystems, on the other hand, often introduce plants with water needs that exceed the ability of the natural ecosystem to supply those needs. When this is the case, irrigation is used to provide adequate soil moisture for crops.

Irrigation represents a major change in ecosystem function, and generates its own particular ecological problems. At the same time, water supply systems are costly in terms of both money and energy. Their use must balance ecological and economic costs if long-term sustainability is to be achieved.

**FIGURE 9.6** **Dry-farmed olives in Andalucia, Spain.** This deep-rooted perennial crop is well suited to regions with limited rainfall and difficult access to irrigation.

when water is withheld from cotton plants in late summer to force defoliation and avoid the need for chemical defoliants

before harvest.

Many plants have specific structures or metabolic pathways that aid in survival under water-stressed conditions. Farmers in an area subject to periodic water stress would do well to look for crop species and varieties that demonstrate some of these adaptive traits. Some examples of droughttolerant crops are certain cacti species, garbanzo beans, sesame, nut crops such as pistachio, and certain deep-rooted perennials such as olives and dates (Figure 9.6).

Water harvesting, storage, and delivery systems can have major impacts on surface and subterranean water flow. Aquifers can be overdrafted, and the ecology of riverine, riparian, and wetland ecosystems can be severely damaged. Since maintaining healthy waterways and water supplies is as important as maintaining profitable crop production, the impacts of water supply systems on local and regional hydrology must be taken into account (Postel 2010).

**S** **alt** **B** **uildup**

Nearly all irrigation waters contain salts that can damage crops if allowed to accumulate. Since irrigation is used primarily in areas with high _ET_ potential, the deposition of salts at the soil surface over time is inevitable. If uncon trolled, this buildup, called **salinization**, can reach levels unfavorable for crop production, especially when the salts contain toxic trace elements such as boron and selenium

**CASE STUDY: INTERCROPPING WITH HYDRAULIC LIFT SHRUBS IN ARID WEST AFRICA**

In parts of the Sahel region in Africa, where desertification and soil degradation threaten the ability of people to grow enough food, many farmers successfully grow crops of peanuts or millet in association with two native shrubs, _Guiera_ _senegalensis_ and _Piliostigma reticulatum_ . These crops are generally more likely to survive drought periods during the growing season of the semiarid Sahel than the same crops grown without the shrubs.

A group of scientists from universities and research institutions in Senegal, France, and the United States are undertaking a multiyear, National Science Foundation–funded research project to determine what mechanisms and interactions are responsible for the positive effects of this shrub intercropping. Initial research has confirmed that the shrubs do indeed help the crop plants: optimized shrub–crop systems (in which the shrubs are at a higher density and are not managed through the traditional practice of burning) in many cases show higher yields for peanuts and millet than nonshrub systems.

Further research has established that the soil in the vicinity of the shrubs remains higher in soil carbon content, microbial diversity and activity, and moisture throughout the long 6- to 9-month dry season than soil outside of the shrub canopies. There is also strong evidence that both _G. senegalensis_ and _P. reticulatum_ are able to transfer water from deeper soil layers to the rhizosphere near the soil surface through the process of hydraulic lift (see Movement of Water in the Soil section).

Even though the amount of water that is hydraulically lifted is relatively small, the researchers hypothesize that it is nevertheless important in assisting crop plants through periods of drought stress. But the evidence they’ve collected indicates that the benefits that the crop plants receive from the hydraulically lifted water are not entirely direct—rather, they are mediated by soil microorganisms. The microorganisms thrive in the moist environments surrounding shrub roots—and not in the drier soil further away. The researchers hypothesize that these microorganisms produce plantgrowth-promoting and pathogen-suppressing compounds that benefit the crop plants. It is also possible that mycorrhizal fungi present in the soil microbe community establish hyphal linkages between the roots of the shrubs and the roots of the crop plants and help transfer both water and nutrients to the crops.

**112** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

The researchers are carrying out experiments and investigations to test their hypotheses and to obtain quantitative measurements of water transfer, microbial biomass, production of plant-growth-promoting compounds, the shrubs’ contribution to reduction of crop–plant drought stress, and other important factors. Their findings and data could provide the basis for designing agroecosystems for the Sahel region that are resistant to drought, have reduced needs for external inputs like pesticides and fertilizers, and help conserve soil and water resources. The scientifically validated principles and practices developed for the Sahel might then be applied to the design of similar systems in other semiarid regions of the world, helping to address food security and ecological challenges (Figure 9.7).

During the dry season, when the crop is not growing, the shrubs are not coppiced; their root systems remain intact and functioning throughout the cycle. (Photo courtesy of Nate Bogie.)

(Figure 9.8). Total salt content is measured as electrical conductivity in mhos. For each 1.0 mmho/cm of applied irrigation water, the salt content of the water increases by about 640 ppm. Careful monitoring of salt levels in irrigated soils, along with analysis of the salt content of incoming irrigation water, can help avoid excessive buildup.

Because of the inevitability of salt buildup in most irrigated systems, long-term sustainability is not possible without adequate natural or artificial drainage that removes the accumulated salts from the upper layers of the soil. Rainfall is the primary natural leaching agent. In the absence of sufficient rainfall, it is necessary to construct systems of drains, ditches, and canals as described earlier. Excess irrigation water is applied periodically to dissolve salts, and the saltladen water either leaches below the productive root zone or is removed through surface drainage from the crop fields.

A natural consequence of farming in dry areas where _ET_ is high and irrigation water carries appreciable salt loads is that the water leaving the agroecosystem will have a higher salt concentration than the water applied. Care needs to be taken, therefore, not to salinize the areas receiving the outflow, be they soils, the groundwater, or surface water systems.

The introduction of irrigation water into a farming region during a normally dry part of the year may have profound effects on natural ecological cycles and the life cycles of both beneficial and pest organisms. Under natural conditions, seasonal drought may have been a very important means of reducing the buildup of pests and diseases, acting much as frost or flooding does in other regions to disrupt the life

**E** **fficiency** **of** **W** **ater** **U** **se**

The biomass produced by a plant with a given amount of water can be used as a measure of the efficiency of the use of water applied to an agroecosystem. When this efficiency is expressed as dry matter produced per unit of water transpired it is called transpiration ( _T_ ) efficiency, and when it is calculated on the basis of dry matter produced per unit of water lost through both evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration, it is called _ET_ efficiency.

cycles of these organisms. Loss of this natural control mechanism can have serious consequences in terms of outbreaks and increased resistance to artificial control strategies.

Another type of change that may result from introducing irrigation into naturally dry areas is local or regional climate change caused by the increased evaporation from surface water storage areas or from farm fields where water is applied. Elevated humidity in the atmosphere can be connected to increased pest and disease problems, and might also be associated with shifts in the distribution and quantity of precipitation. The off-farm effects of irrigation must be considered along with its on-farm effects when the larger context of sustainability is applied.

**OPTIMIZING USE OF THE WATER RESOURCE**

Soil moisture is managed optimally in agroecosystems designed to ensure that the primary route for water out of the soil is through the crop. The focus for management, therefore, is to reduce evaporation and increase the flow through transpiration. Farming practices that encourage this differential

Data suggest that crops such as corn, sorghum, and millet have relatively high _T_ efficiencies, since they use less water to produce 1 kg of dry matter. In contrast, legumes such as alfalfa have low _T_ efficiencies and depend on high moisture inputs for each kg of dry matter produced. Most cereal and vegetable crops are intermediate. Average _T_ efficiencies for a number of important crop plants are shown in Figure 9.9.

It takes a large amount of water to bring a crop plant to maturity. For example, a representative crop of corn containing 10,000 kg/ha of dry matter and having a transpiration ratio of 350 would draw the equivalent of 35 cm of water per hectare from the soil. This moisture must be in the soil at the

time the plants need it, or growth will suffer. Add evaporation losses to this figure, and it can be seen how moisture is often the most critical factor in production in moisturelimited regions.

Research focusing on breeding for increasing the _T_ efficiency of crops has shown little success in significantly altering the _T_ efficiency ratio (Sinclair 2012). Without other conditions being limiting, the amount of water needed to produce a unit of dry matter of a crop species or variety in a given climate is relatively constant. More intensive research is needed on

more diverse physiological variables such as photosynthetic rates and limits to water flow inside the plant. But overall the lack of success in altering _T_ efficiency would suggest that we need to continue focusing on managing environmental variables such as control of evaporation from the soil surface.

**Evapotranspiration Efficiency** Since soil itself is quite variable, _ET_ efficiency is also extremely variable. However, by changing soil and crop management practices that affect evaporation from the soil, as described in the following, desirable changes in _ET_ efficiency can be readily obtained. Ideally, the ratio of transpirational water loss to evaporative water loss should be as high as possible. A higher _T_ to _E_ ratio indicates more movement of water through the plant, and hence, a higher potential for production of plant biomass per unit of water used. Sustainable water management places greatest emphasis, then, on reducing _E_ so as to have more moisture for _T_ and related plant growth and development processes.

**M** **anaging** **E** **vapotranspiration**

Since transpiration is a plant process that is subject to only minor control if a plant is otherwise growing normally, it is best to focus on reducing evaporative loss by managing the way the plants are grown.

**Crop Choice and Agroecosystem Design** The choice of plant species and the timing of cropping can influence both _T_ and _ET_ efficiency. Choosing a crop with less intensive water needs, such as corn or sorghum, in an area with very high _ET_ and limited water for irrigation is one good strategy for soil moisture management. It may also be useful to shift the growing of more water-intensive crops to a cooler time of the year when moisture loss potential is lower.

Greater vegetative cover can reduce evaporation dramatically. One way of gaining more cover is to use intercropping techniques. A forest plantation, for example, shades the soil surface, whereas an apple orchard with widely separated rows of trees has much more evaporative soil surface exposed. But an increase in plant cover (higher LAI) can also be a liability in drier regions, since lower evaporation rates can be offset by much higher transpiration rates, depleting soil moisture reserves more rapidly.

**Fallow Cropping** In moisture-limited parts of the world such as the Great Plains of the United States and the southeastern wheat belt

of Australia, farmers sometimes alternate between cropping 1 year and fallow the next to conserve soil moisture. The elimination of transpirational losses from a crop during the fallow year allows soil moisture to be stored for the planting year. Stubble from the previous crop is usually left on the soil surface during the fallow year to limit evaporative losses, and then some kind of soil cultivation or herbicide treatment is used during the fallow season to minimize transpiration losses from weeds. Alternatively, a pasture crop

Soil moisture gained during the fallow year combines with rainfall during the following cropping year to permit a successful wheat harvest.

is sown toward the end of the cropping year and left as a grazed cover during the fallow year. Although low rainfall during the fallow year can cause lower crop yields during the cropping year, a crop planted following a year of fallow will generally have a higher yield than if planted without fallow. In fact, as long as sufficient rainfall for recharge is received during the fallow year, there is much less risk of crop failure if the crop season turns out to be a drought year (Figure 9.10).

**Managing Surface Evaporation** Evaporation directly from the soil surface normally returns to the atmosphere more than half the moisture gained from precipitation. This degree of evaporative loss occurs not only in dryland regions, but in irrigated arid and rainfed humid regions as well. Depending on other factors, plant growth may suffer as a result of the loss of moisture through surface evaporation. Any practice that covers the soil will aid in the reduction of evaporative losses.

_Organic Mulches_

A wide range of plant- and animal-derived materials can be used to cover the surface of the soil as mulch in order to

reduce evaporation (and to reduce weed growth and transpirational losses from the weeds). Commonly used materials include sawdust, leaves, straw, composted agricultural wastes, manure, and crop residues. Mulches provide a very effective barrier to moisture loss, and have special application in intensive garden and small-farm systems, or with high-value crops such as strawberries, blackberries, and some other fruit crops. Mulches work best when the cropping system requires only infrequent cultivation or relies mostly on hand weeding.

Mulching provides a viable option for soil water management, but at the same time has many other beneficial effects. It protects the soil from erosion, returns organic matter and

lowers evaporation is created. The residue mulch protects the boundary layer at the surface of the soil, and provides a barrier against the capillary flow of water to the surface. The lower temperatures created by the mulch barrier probably help reduce evaporation as well.

nutrients to the soil, alters the surface reflectivity (albedo), increases the boundary layer for gaseous diffusion, and allows better infiltration of incoming rainfall. All of these factors interact (Figures 9.11 and 9.12).

_Artificial Mulches_

A range of specially manufactured papers and plastics are now available for use as mulches. Such materials can be easily spread out and firmly secured to the soil surface. When these “mulches” are spread directly over planted beds, slits or holes can be made for the crop plants. Moisture loss is greatly reduced and crop yields very often are increased. Some plastics provide a concentrated greenhouse effect as well, raising soil temperatures several degrees. This is a very important benefit for crops that are planted during the colder time of the year, such as strawberries in coastal California (Figure 9.13).

_Crop Residues and Reduced Tillage_

By leaving a high percentage of the residue from the cropping season on the surface of the soil, a protective barrier that

Reduced-tillage and no-till techniques are often combined by using crop residues as mulch. A major goal of most reduced-tillage systems is to develop greater soil cover to reduce evaporative losses from the surface. In no-till systems, seeds are sown directly into the sod or under residues of the previous crop with no plowing or disking, allowing the plant material to remain as a barrier to evaporative loss. Stubble mulching is a common practice in subhumid and semiarid areas where enough biomass is produced by the previous crop to provide sufficient soil cover. The residue is chopped or mown and spread evenly over the surface, and then special tillage implements that can penetrate the mulch are used to plant the following crop. Despite their positive impact on soil moisture, reduced-tillage systems have potential drawbacks. These include increased dependence on herbicides for weed management, buildup of soil pathogens from crop residues, and the need for more complex and costly farming equipment.

_Soil Mulch_

A natural soil mulch, also called a dust mulch, made from a cultivated dry soil layer on the surface of the soil, can conserve moisture in regions with a distinct alternation between the wet and dry season. This dry layer breaks the capillary flow of water to the surface, and the process of its creation eliminates weeds that might tap moisture below the dry layer

**116** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

and increase transpirational losses. These benefits, however, must be weighed against potential negative impacts such as increased costs for cultivation, a greater threat of soil erosion from rain and wind, and the loss of organic matter from the dry layer.

**FUTURE RESEARCH**

When sustainability is the primary goal, moisture in the soil is managed so that it remains as close as possible to the optimum required to maintain the best growth and development of the crop. This means going beyond simply removing water when it is in excess and adding it when it is deficient. Sustainability requires an in-depth understanding of how water functions in the soil and at the plant–soil interface. Efficiency of uptake of water and its conversion to plant biomass can be one indicator of agroecosystem sustainability. Further development and testing of water management strategies are needed, especially those that view water in the context of the larger cycles and patterns that link the farm with the surrounding environments from which water comes and ultimately returns after passing through the farm.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. In rainfall-deficient regions, the lack of soil mois ture for crop production can be dealt with in two ways: (1) developing crops or cropping systems that are adapted to the low levels of moisture or (2) introducing irrigation to overcome the water deficit. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach? 2. What are some of the reasons that farmers must be

aware of the “downstream” effects of their use of

irrigation? 3. A period without rainfall long enough to create

moisture stress in the soil, or a period of waterlogging long enough to create limiting conditions of anaerobiosis in the soil ecosystem, can help control pest populations and diseases in the soil that might otherwise cause crop loss. When these natural events are removed from a particular soil system, what alternative pest and disease management strategies could be employed? 4. How is competition for water between urban regions

and agroecosystems affecting natural ecosystems? How might the water needs of all three be better balanced? How will climate change affect the use of water in your local area?
