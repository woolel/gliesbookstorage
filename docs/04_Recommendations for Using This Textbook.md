## Recommendations for Using This Textbook

Reflecting agroecology’s origins in both the pure-science
field of ecology and the applied field of agronomy, this text
has a dual identity: In one sense, it is designed to teach ecology in the context of agriculture; in another sense, it teaches
about agriculture from an ecological perspective.

Despite its attention to the practice of growing food,
however, this is not a book on how to farm. Farming is an
activity that must be adapted to the particular conditions
of each region of the world, and this text’s mission is to
create an understanding of concepts that are of universal
applicability.

The text has been written to accommodate a range of
experience and knowledge levels in both ecology and agriculture. Sections I, II, and III assume only a basic knowledge
of ecology and biology, and even those students with minimal college-level science training should have little difficulty
comprehending the material if they are diligent. Intensive
study of Chapters 1 through 13 will prepare any student for
the more complex chapters of Sections IV, V, and VI.

Readers with extensive background in ecology will benefit most from the three latter sections. They may want to
skim Chapter 2 for review, and then read Chapters 3 through
13 selectively before turning their attention to the next three
sections. Readers with advanced training in both ecology and
agriculture, including advanced undergraduates, may want
to pursue this strategy as well, supplementing the text with

additional materials that provide more extensive literature
review and reports on research findings.

The text can be used in either a one-quarter or onesemester course, but the rate at which material is covered
will depend greatly on the instructor, the students, and the
curriculum. Ideally, a laboratory section will complement
the lecture section of any course using this textbook, allowing the testing of ecological concepts in agriculture, and the
demonstration of how the tools of ecology can be applied to
the study of agroecosystems. The accompanying lab manual, _Field and Laboratory Investigations in Agroecology_, is
designed to fill this role. Its investigations are keyed to the
chapters in this text, and the two work together to create an
integrated course.

Suggested readings and a list of Internet resources at the
end of each chapter provide further materials for the curious
reader. The questions following each chapter are open ended,
designed to encourage the reader to consider the ideas and
concepts presented in the broader context of sustainability.

The concepts and principles in this text can be applied to
agroecosystems anywhere in the world. Just as a farmer must
adjust to local and changing conditions, readers of this book
are challenged to make the necessary adaptations to apply its
contents to their own situations—finding appropriate examples and case studies in the research literature and working
with local farmers to connect principles to actual practices.
