## 16. Species Interactions in Crop Communities

In ecological terms, a cropping system is a _community_ formed by a complex of interacting populations of crops, weeds, microorganisms, insects, and sometimes other animals. The interactions among the populations of the crop community, which arise from the different kinds of interference, give the community characteristics, called emergent qualities, which exist only at the community level. These emergent qualities cannot be fully explained in terms of the properties of populations or individuals. In both natural ecosystems and agroecosystems, community-level phenomena are of critical importance in a system’s resilience, productivity, and dynamic functioning.

Agricultural researchers, however, normally focus their attention on the crop population of central importance in the farming system, rather than on the community of which it is a part. Because of this reductionist approach, they fail to understand cropping systems _as_ communities, and thereby lose the ability to take advantage of community-level emergent qualities or to manipulate community interactions to the benefit of the cropping system.

To be sure, industrial agriculture has been greatly concerned with some species interactions—it has focused on the detrimental effects on crop yields arising from the impacts of noncrop organisms such as weeds, pest herbivores, and diseases on the crop environment. Research for many years has been directed toward eliminating these detrimental effects. Noncrop organisms are said to “compete” with the crop or have a yield-reducing effect; they must therefore be eliminated from the cropping system. At the same time, considerable research has been done to determine the optimum densities for each crop (usually planted as a monoculture) in order to minimize intraspecific competition for resources and thereby obtain maximum yields.

By striving to eliminate and minimize interactions, the industrial approach tends to simplify the crop community. In a sense, the ultimate goal is to reduce it to a single-crop population growing in an otherwise sterile abiotic environment.

In contrast, the agroecological approach to cropping system management is to understand species interactions in the context of the larger community. The agroecologist recognizes the existence of beneficial species interactions, understands how they arise from the impacts of interference, and knows that a certain level of complexity is desirable. By paying attention to the ecology of the crop community, it is possible to create beneficial interactions and emergent qualities that not only reduce the need for external inputs, but also increase overall yields.

**INTERFERENCE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL**

The basis for understanding species interactions in the context of community structure and function was developed in Chapter 11. There, we discussed how organism–organism interactions can be conceptualized as _interferences_, in which an organism has some kind of impact on its environment, and through this impact another organism is affected. We identified two types of interferences: removal interferences, in which the environmental impact consists of the removal of some resource by one or both of the interacting organisms, and addition interferences, in which one or both organisms add some substance or structure to the environment. Either kind of interference can have beneficial, detrimental, or neutral effects on neighboring organisms. As was discussed in Chapter 11, the advantage of the interference approach is that it allows a more complete understanding of the _mechanisms_ of interaction.

At the level of the community, the existence of many populations means that many kinds of interferences may be going on at the same time. These many interferences may interact with and modify each other, creating complex relationships among the members of the community. Despite this complexity, however, we can understand both the individual types of interference that exist between populations and the overall effect of the complex of interferences on the community as a whole because the interference concept allows analysis of the mechanisms of interaction.

Some of the ways in which interferences may combine to affect the crop community are described in Figure 16.1. Direct removal of something from the environment leads to interactions such as competition or herbivory, whereas additions can lead to allelopathy or the production of food for beneficial organisms in the crop community. Both removal and addition interferences may go on simultaneously, leading to different types of interactions. Many mutualisms, for example, arise from combined addition/removal interferences. Examples are pollination (removal of nectar and addition of pollen) and biological nitrogen fixation (addition of fixed nitrogen by the bacteria and removal of nitrogen by the legume). Additionally, combined addition/removal interference between populations may modify the microclimate of a cropping system in ways that affect populations of other species. Shading, soil insulation, temperature and wind modification, and altered moisture relations are all potential consequences of addition and removal interferences that can combine to create a microclimate within the cropping

**C** **omplexity** **of** **I** **nteractions**

The ways in which the various populations of a crop community influence the community as a whole through their interferences may be complex and difficult to discern. An example will help to illustrate this point.

Canopy development over time was studied in a grass and clover mixture. The data from this study are shown in Figure 16.2. When the interaction between grass and clover is considered without any nitrogen being added, it appears that competition for limited light under the canopy of the crop mixture takes place. Shading by the clover appears to inhibit the grass. We could conclude from these data that due to its mutualism with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the clover is able to avoid nitrogen competition and establish dominance. But the data obtained from adding different amounts of nitrogen fertilizer to the mixture alter the picture of

community dynamics. The effect of adding nitrogen is to shift the balance of species dominance: by the last sample date the mixture at low nitrogen levels is dominated by clover, but the mixture at high nitrogen levels is dominated by grass. The advantage of one crop over the other is altered by availability of nitrogen, with grass becoming more dominant as nitrogen supply is increased. These data lead to somewhat different conclusions: perhaps competition for light is the key factor, or perhaps some complex interaction of light, nitrogen availability, and some other factor (e.g., allelopathic chemicals added to the soil by the grass) is at work in the crop mixture.

These data raise other questions. For example, what would happen in a crop mixture where the two species involved had very similar nitrogen needs and procurement abilities? Under conditions of limited nitrogen supply, competition would probably result, and both species might suffer, but eventually one would begin to dominate the other. But another outcome is possible. The two different species could have complementary ways of using nitrogen when it is in limited supply: their timing of growth might be different, or their root systems might occupy different regions in the soil. They could thus avoid competition and coexist in the

same system.

**C** **oexistence**

In complex natural communities, populations of ecologically similar organisms often share the same habitat without significant apparent competitive interference, even though their niches overlap to a considerable degree. Similarly, it is often the case in natural communities that more than one species share the role of dominant species. It would appear, then, that the principle of competitive exclusion, which implies that two species with similar needs cannot occupy the same niche or place in the environment, does not fully apply in many communities.

Species Interactions in Crop Communities **193**

The ability to “avoid” competition and instead coexist in mixed communities leads to advantages for all involved members of the community. Therefore, this ability may well provide significant selective advantage in an evolutionary sense. Although selection for competitive ability has undoubtedly been very important in evolution, ecologists who study evolutionary biology now more widely accept the idea that selection for coexistence may be more the rule than the exception, especially in more mature communities (Pianka 2000).

Recent thinking on this issue has generated the term _competitive neutrality_ as a substitute for coexistence. Some ecologists take this a step further and argue that not only do different species often tolerate each other and coexist in the same environment, but they may also cocreate conditions through their interactions that facilitate each other’s growth (Vandermeer 2011). The ability of multiple species to accommodate each other in a common environment in this way has been termed **facilitation** . Facilitation will be discussed in

more detail in the Mutualisms section if this chapter.

It is possible, too, that many domesticated species have undergone directed selection for coexistence by being grown most commonly in polycultures for many thousands of years. In this context, the plants would have coevolved, each developing adaptations for coexistence. (The traditional corn– bean–squash polyculture discussed later in this chapter is a possible example.)

Mixed populations are able to coexist due to many different mechanisms, such as resource partitioning, niche diversification, or specific physiological, behavioral, or genetic changes that reduce direct competition and allow for its avoidance. Understanding the mechanisms of interference that make coexistence possible could form an important foundation for the design of multiple crop communities.

In agroecosystems, combining species with slightly different physiological characteristics or resource needs is an important way of allowing for the coexistence of species in a multiple cropping community. Such an approach to designing the cropping community has much greater potential than trying to maintain single-species dominance in a monocultural field where considerable human intervention is needed to keep out potentially competing noncrop weeds or herbivorous pest insects. Successful mixed crop communities around the world offer fruitful ground for research on how avoidance of competition, or coexistence, plays an important ecological role in cropping systems.

**M** **utualisms**

Species with a mutualistic relationship are not only able to coexist, but they are dependent on each other for optimal development. Mutualisms are likely the result of coexisting species continuing in the same evolutionary direction, coevolving adaptations for achieving mutual benefit through some kind of close association. Ecologists now know that mutualistic relationships among organisms of different species are relatively common in complex natural communities, creating intricate interdependencies among community

members. Their prevalence is another factor explaining the observed complexity and diversity of many communities and their food webs. The same coevolutionary process has undoubtedly also occurred during domestication in agriculture, either by deliberate human selection or coincidentally in the context of multiple cropping systems.

The types of mutualisms that are most commonly recognized include the following:

**• Inhabitational mutualisms.** One mutualist lives

wholly or partly inside the other. A classic example is the relationship between _Rhizobium_ bacteria and leguminous plants. The bacteria in this relationship are unable to fix nitrogen outside of the nodules formed on the plant roots, and they usually exist only as spores in the open soil, reproducing only while inside the nodule. This mutualism is the cor nerstone of many of the most sustainable farming systems around the world.

**• Exhabitational** **mutualisms.** The organisms involved are relatively independent physically, but interact directly. An example is the relationship between a flowering plant and its pollinating insect. Many crop plants are unable to produce fertile seed without pollination from bees, and the bees depend on the crop plants for their main source of food in the form of nectar or pollen.

**• Indirect mutualisms.** The interactions among a set

of species modify the environment in which they all live to the benefit of the mixture. An example is a polyculture agroecosystem. A tall crop species can modify conditions of the microclimate to the benefit of associated crop species, and the presence of several crops attracts a range of beneficial arthropods that facilitate the biological management of potential pests. Unlike the first two types of mutualisms, indirect mutualisms involve more than two species. Indirect mutualisms can also include both inhabita tional and exhabitational mutualisms.

Some mutualisms are obligate for all involved members, while in others only one of the members may require the relationship. In other cases, called facultative mutualisms, all members of the mutualism may be able to survive quite well without the interaction, but definitely do better when in relationship. Often, the mutualism functions not so much because of some stimulus or direct benefit to the organisms involved, but because it helps the species avoid some negative impact or impacts.

The expansion of the theory of mutualism in ecology has begun to find ready application in the development of more diverse cropping communities in which mutualistic relationships can occur. Importantly, farmers are not limited to mutualistic relationships that evolved between two particular species; they can take advantage of the more generalized _capacity_ for mutualism that exists between members of many taxonomic groups. For example, _Rhizobium_ bacteria

**SPECIAL TOPIC: HISTORY OF THE STUDY OF MUTUALISM**

The idea that organisms may relate to each other in mutually beneficial ways has a very long history (Boucher 1985). The ancient Greeks and Romans recognized that nature was full of examples of plants and animals helping each other. In his _History_, for example, the historian Herodotus describes such a relationship between a plover and a crocodile. The bird helps the crocodile by picking and eating leeches from the crocodile’s mouth, and the crocodile never harms the bird even though a simple snap of its jaws would provide it with lunch.

In the 1600s, the theory of natural theology promoted the view that plants and animals sometimes selflessly aided each other in concert with the natural order of things. Divine Providence, it was believed, gave each organism a specific role to play in the larger “society” of the natural world and that some organisms had the role of guardian or helper.

As the industrial revolution progressed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the idea that competition among organisms was the driving force in nature gained prominence in science. The publication of Charles Darwin’s _Origin of Species_ was pivotal in bringing emphasis to competition, because it posited that the “struggle for existence” was the primary selective pressure in the evolutionary process. Interpretations and popularizations of Darwin’s work went even further in casting nature as “red in tooth and claw.”

Soon after the publication of the _Origin of Species_, however, interest in the concept of mutualism was revived. The term itself was officially introduced in 1873 by Pierre Van Beneden in a lecture to the royal Academy of Belgium, and in 1877, Alfred Espinas’ doctoral thesis documented multiple examples of mutualisms. Then, in an important 1893 paper, Roscoe Pound finally challenged the romantic notion of mutualism as help given freely and selflessly between organisms, explaining that each organism in a mutualism is simply acting in its own self interest. The plover, for example, is obtaining food, and the crocodile is being relieved of parasites. The fact that such an interaction is mutually beneficial makes it a mutualism; the individual organism’s intent is irrelevant.

As ecology developed into a science in the twentieth century, interest in mutualisms remained at the fringes of the discipline, with most research on community-level interaction focusing on competition. Mutualism did not emerge as an important area of study until the 1970s. Today every ecology text includes extensive discussion and examples of the role of mutualisms in species interactions and community dynamics, helping further explain niche diversification and the coexistence of so many species in ecosystems. Competitive and mutualistic interactions are now seen as parallel components of such important concepts as dominance, coevolution, and diversity.

Mutualisms have historically been important to agriculture, which in itself can be viewed as an obligate mutualism between humans and the crop plants and livestock we have domesticated. Traditional agroecosystems developed around facilitating mutualisms such as the _Rhizobium_ –legume relationship (described in the next chapter), and coordinating the influences of beneficial insects and noncrop species. Industrial agriculture tends to eliminate these beneficial interactions and replace them with human-derived inputs.

can form nodules on the roots of most plants in the Fabaceae (legume) family. Making such relationships an integral part of crop communities is key to establishing sustainable systems that require fewer external inputs and less human intervention.

By contributing beneficial interactions mutualisms in agroecosystems increase the resistance of the entire system to the negative impacts of pests, diseases, and weeds. At the same time, the efficiency of energy capture, nutrient uptake, and recycling in the system may be improved. Whenever mutualistic relationships can be incorporated into the organization of the cropping community, sustainability is much easier to achieve and maintain.

**MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL INTERFERENCES**

**AT WORK IN AGROECOSYSTEMS**

Many sustainable traditional agroecosystems, upon analysis, reveal species interactions and modes of interference that benefit the community as a whole. Similar agroecosystems have been developed out of agroecological research and

practical experimentation by farmers. These systems are based on the purposeful combining of various crop and noncrop species—including covercrops with crops, weeds with crops, and crops with other crops—in order to allow coexistence and take advantage of mutualistic relationships.

**B** **eneficial** **I** **nterferences** **of** **C** **overcrops**

In a crop community, covercrops are plant species (usually grasses or legumes) grown in pure or mixed stands to cover the soil of the crop community for part or all of the year. They are often planted after the harvest of the primary crop to cover the soil during the fallow season, but they can also be planted in alternating years with the primary crop or grown in association with the primary crop. The covercrop plants may be incorporated into the soil by tillage in seasonal covercrop systems, or retained as live or dead plants on the soil surface for several seasons. When covercrops are tilled into the soil, the organic matter added to the soil is called **green manure** . When the covercrops are grown directly in association with other crops, they are called living mulch (Figure 16.3).

Species Interactions in Crop Communities **195**

to the crop community—known to agriculture for a long time—include reduced soil erosion, improved soil structure, enhanced soil fertility, and suppression of weeds, insects and pathogens. Some covercrops can even be used for animal feed or grazing, with the animals adding manure that is reincorporated back into the soil along with any residual plant matter. When covercrops can fulfill these roles in the crop community, there is less need for human manipulation and external inputs. Table 16.1 lists many of the benefits of covercrops along with the interferences (environmental impacts) that make them possible.

**FIGURE 16.3** **Covercrop of belbean (** _**V. faba**_ **) and barley** **(** _**H. vulgare**_ **), Watsonville, CA.** This mixed covercrop inhibits weed growth, and when its biomass is returned to the soil, it adds organic matter and fixed nitrogen.

No matter how they are incorporated into the crop community, covercrops have important impacts on the environment, many of which can be highly beneficial. These impacts arise from the ability of covercrops to modify the soil–atmosphere interface, to offer physical protection of the soil from sunlight, wind, and rain, and to engage in a variety of addition and removal interferences. The benefits that accrue

**TABLE 16.1** **Potential Benefits of Covercrops**

Despite the proven benefit of covercrops in general, their use must be tailored to the individual agroecosystem. The farmer needs to know how a covercrop species will interact with other organisms in the crop system, as well as how it will impact the conditions of the environment in which they all live. In addition, it must be remembered that forms of interference between members of the crop community that may be of benefit at one time may be a liability at another. If resources in the crop system are limiting, the covercrop can create competitive interference. If allowed to become too dense, some covercrop species may be allelopathic to the crop. Residues or breakdown products of incorporated covercrops may produce growth-suppressing substances. Damaging herbivores or disease organisms may find the covercrop species to be an ideal alternate host, later moving onto the crop. Covercrop residue may also interfere

**CASE STUDY: COVERCROPPING WITH RYE AND BELLBEANS**

Multispecies covercrop systems often confer greater benefits to the agroecosystem than a covercrop of just one of the component species. These benefits arise from interactions between the species in the mixture.

One such system has been studied at the farm facility at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). A legume (bellbean) is mixed with a grass (cereal rye) as a winter covercrop for vegetable fields. This multispecies covercrop has been used by local farmers since the turn of the century. Farmers plant the grass–legume mixture following the harvest of the summer crop, before winter rains begin. It is allowed to grow through the cool, wet months of winter and is disked into the soil in March or early April. The summer vegetable crop is then planted toward the end of May. The UCSC study used cabbage as the vegetable crop (Table 16.2).

Rye produces significant amounts of biomass and limits weed growth in the plots, most likely through the release of allelopathic chemicals (Brooks 2008). Bellbeans bring nitrogen into the system through their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, but they produce limited biomass and have only a minor effect on weed growth. When bellbeans and rye are planted together, the advantages of both are combined: the mixture suppresses weed growth, is highly productive, and adds nitrogen to the system. But that is not all. The mixed covercrop does a better job of increasing nitrogen levels in the soil than does a legume-only crop, even when the legume-only crop has a higher legume biomass. It is possible that the increased organic matter being disked in with the bellbeans slows decomposition, retaining more nitrogen in the soil.

The mixed covercrop also proves to be of benefit to the vegetable crop that follows it. Although cabbage yield was highest in the bellbean–only treatment, it was not statistically different from the high cabbage yield of the rye–bellbean treatment, and both yields were significantly higher than those for rye alone and the control. Because of the greater bulk of organic matter it adds to the soil, the mixed covercrop would probably show the greatest benefits over a period of many

years.

The case study Covercropping with Rye and Bellbeans describes a study that demonstrates the ability of covercrops, especially those that are made up of mixed species, to control weeds and increase the yield of the subsequent main crop.

**B** **eneficial** **I** **nterferences** **of** **W** **eeds**

Weeds in cropping systems are most often considered to be detrimental, competing with the crop species and thereby reducing yields. Although weeds do often have negative effects on crops, it has been clearly shown that in many circumstances weeds and other noncrop plants may benefit the crop community through their effects on the environment

(Radosevich et al. 1997). The use potential of such _“_ noncrop _”_ species in traditional cultures has been known for a long time (Chacón and Gliessman 1982). Weeds exert their beneficial influences in much the same way as covercrops and often fill the same ecological roles; with proper management based on an understanding of the mechanisms of weeds’ interactions, farmers can take advantage of their positive effects.

**Modification of the Cropping System Environment** Weeds can protect the soil surface from erosion through root and foliar cover, take up nutrients that might otherwise be leached from the system, add organic matter to the soil, and selectively inhibit the development of more noxious species through allelopathy. Most of these benefits of weeds

**CASE STUDY: MUSTARD COVERCROP FOR FUJI APPLES**

Using covercrops to suppress the growth of invasive weeds can help reduce the need for herbicides in an agroecosystem. To be useful, however, a covercrop must exclude other weeds without inhibiting the growth of the crop plant. Wild mustard ( _Brassica kaber_ ) appears to be a covercrop that meets these requirements well when planted in fruit orchards (Figure 16.4).

In a study of the conversion from conventional to organic management of young Fuji semidwarf apple trees, James Paulus, a graduate student researcher at the UCSC, demonstrated the potential use of mustard as a covercrop species (Paulus 1994). He grew several different types of covercrops between the trees in different plots and examined their effectiveness at weed control. The covercrop treatments were compared to conventional management with herbicides and to an organic conversion plot using plastic tarp for weed control.

Mustard was the only covercrop tested that controlled weeds as effectively as conventional herbicides or plastic tarp. Forty-five days after mustard emerged it had displaced nearly all of the other weed plants in the plot and it accounted for 99% of the total weed biomass present. Other covercrops only achieved partial dominance, accounting for no more than 42% of the total weed biomass in their respective plots.

It appears that mustard achieves this level of dominance through allelopathic inhibition of other weeds. Many members of the genus _Brassica_, including mustard, have been observed to inhibit weed growth in the field, and research has shown they contain allelopathic chemicals called glucosinolates that inhibit seed germination (Gliessman 1987; Zukalová and Vašák 2002; Haramoto and Gallandt 2004). Seeds of monocot grasses—often a problem as weeds—are the most strongly inhibited.

Paulus found that the mustard not only inhibited weeds effectively, but actually helped increase apple production. Trees in the plots with a mustard covercrop produced more than three times as many apples per tree as trees in the conventional plots. And the trees grown with mustard increased in girth more rapidly, showing diameters as much as 50% larger than trees in the conventional plots after 2 years.

At least part of the yield advantage in the mustard-cover-cropped plots was due to improved nutrient cycling. Analysis showed that the weed cover took up significant amounts of nitrogen during the winter, lowering its concentrations in the soil. When the winter rains came, nitrogen in the bare soil treatments was leached out and lost from the system, whereas the nitrogen in the covercrop treatments was immobilized in the weed biomass. When the covercrop was cut down in the spring, the nitrogen was made available to the trees to use for spring and summer growth.

stem from the fact that ecologically weeds are _r_ -selected pioneer species, invading open or disturbed habitats, and through their effects on the environment initiate the process of succession toward more complex communities. Most crop communities, especially those composed of predominantly annual species, are simplified, disturbed habitats. Weeds are especially well adapted to such conditions. When we gain an understanding of the ecological basis of the effects of weeds on the crop environment, we can utilize their interference in ways that reduce the need for inputs from outside the crop community.

**Control of Insect Pests by Promotion** **of Beneficial Insects** Agriculture is usually concerned with keeping both weeds and insects out of the production system. This takes large amounts of external inputs to accomplish, and does not always provide the hoped-for results. When interactions between weeds and insects are examined from an ecological point of view, however, the possibility of retaining weeds in the system in order to control the unwanted insects emerges as an option. A body of literature is accumulating that supports the hypothesis that certain weeds should be regarded as important components of the crop community because of the positive effects they can have on populations of beneficial insects (Nichols and Altieri 2013). Depending on the type of beneficial insect, weeds can modify the microenvironment in ways that provide habitat for the insect, and they can provide alternative food sources such as pollen, nectar, foliage, or prey (Radosevich et al. 1997; Norris and Kogan 2005).

In a study where weed species were planted as narrow border strips (0.25 m wide) around 5 m × 5 m plots of cauliflower, it was found that certain pest insects were reduced as a result of the increase in predatory or parasitic beneficials (Ruiz-Rosado 1984). For example, with the weeds _Spergula_ _arvensis_ (corn spurry) and _Chenopodium album_ (lamb’s quarters) planted in pure borders around the crop, larvae and eggs of the common imported cabbage worm ( _Pieris_ _rapae_ ) and the cabbage looper ( _Trichoplusia ni_ ) were much more heavily parasitized by beneficials such as the tachinid fly _Madremyia saundersii_ . The adult tachinids are attracted to the food sources provided by the weeds and then search out prey on which to lay their eggs in the crop nearby (Figure 16.5).

A study of the fauna associated with various weeds monitored the insects associated with 80 plant species sown as monocultures in a total of 360 plots (Nentwig 1998). Sampling revealed that most weedy species had 100–300 arthropods/m [2] ; 500 or more arthropods were found per square meter on weedy poppy ( _Papaver rhoeas_ ), tansy ( _Tanacetum_ _vulgare_ ), and the crops rape ( _Brassica napus_ ) and buckwheat ( _Fagopyrum esculentum_ ), which may grow adventitiously in areas previously sown to these plants. Considering the trophic structure of the arthropod communities, results were even more striking. Of all arthropods, phytophagous insects constituted about 65% of the species (most values between

**FIGURE 16.5** **A border of corn spurry (** _**S. arvensis**_ **) around** **a cauliflower crop.** The weed’s flowers attract beneficial insects.

45% and 80%) but the composition of the remaining arthropods was split among beneficial pollinators, predators, and parasitoids.

As another example, significant reductions in aphid populations extended throughout the field when _Spergula_ was a more evenly distributed member of the weed/insect/crop complex (Theunissen and van Duden 1980). Leaving weedy borders with grasses and legumes on the margins of corn and soybean fields in Michigan was shown to greatly increase the presence of predatory ground-dwelling carabid beetles in the crops (Landis et al. 2005).

**I** **ntercropping**

Whenever two or more crops are planted together in the same cropping system, the resulting interactions can have mutually beneficial effects and effectively reduce the need for external inputs. The body of information documenting these interactions has grown considerably in recent years (van Noordwijk et al. 2004; Mousavi and Eskandari 2011), and several authors have discussed how an ecological approach to multiple cropping research can provide an understanding of how the benefits of intercropping come about (Vandermeer 2011; Ong et al. 2004).

The most successful intercropping systems are known from the tropics, where a high percentage of agricultural production still is grown in mixtures. Because smaller-scale farmers in the tropics have limited access to purchased inputs, they have developed intercropping combinations that are adapted to low external input management (Joshi et al. 2004; Lithourgidis et al. 2011).

The traditional corn, bean, and squash polyculture cropping system of Central America and Mexico, with roots in the pre-Hispanic period, has been studied in some detail. Both removal and addition interferences occur in this system, leading to habitat modifications and mutualistic relationships of benefit to all three crops (Figure 16.6).

Species Interactions in Crop Communities **199**

three crops together were higher than what would have been obtained in an equivalent area planted to monocultures of the three crops. As shown in Table 16.3, this comparison is made using the concept of _land equivalent ratio_ ( _LER_ ), explained in greater detail in Chapter 17. An LER greater than 1 indicates that an intercropping system is **overyielding** in relation to monocultures of its component crops.

Additional research has identified some of the ecological mechanisms of these yield increases:

```
                              - In a polyculture with corn, beans nodulate more and
```

are potentially more active in biological fixation of nitrogen (Boucher and Espinosa 1982; Santalla et al. 2001; Cardoso 2007).

```
                               - Fixed nitrogen is made directly available to the corn
```

through mycorrhizal fungi connections between root systems (Bethlenfalvay et al. 1991; HauggaardNielsen and Jensen 2005).

```
                              - Net gains of nitrogen in the soil have been observed
```

In a series of studies of the corn–bean–squash polyculture, done in Tabasco, Mexico, it was shown that corn yields could be stimulated as much as 50% beyond monoculture yields when planted with beans and squash using the techniques of local farmers and planting on land that had only been managed using local traditional practices (Amador and Gliessman 1990). There was significant yield reduction for the two associated crop species, but the total yields for the

when the crops are associated, despite its removal with the harvest (Gliessman 1982; Maingi et al. 2001).

- The squash helps control weeds: the thick, broad,

horizontal leaves block sunlight, preventing weed germination and growth, while leachates in rains washing the leaves contain allelopathic compounds that can inhibit weeds (Gliessman 1983; Fujiyoshi et al. 2002, 2007).

- Herbivorous insects are at a disadvantage in the

intercrop system because food sources are less concentrated and more difficult to find in the mixture (Risch 1980; Verkerk et al. 1998; Altieri and Nicholls 2004b, Gurr et al. 2012).

- The presence of beneficial insects is promoted due

to such factors as the availability of more attractive microclimatic conditions and the presence of more diverse pollen and nectar sources (Letourneau 1986; Verkerk et al. 1998).

Interestingly, when the same varieties of corn, bean, and squash were simultaneously planted in the same way in a nearby soil that had at least 10 years of management history involving mechanical cultivation, synthetic chemical fertilizers, and modern pesticides, the yield advantages disappeared. Apparently the positive interactions that occurred in the traditional farm field were inhibited by the alteration of the soil ecosystem that occurred with conventional inputs and practices. This result points to an important link between cultural practices and ecological conditions.

The corn–bean–squash intercrop is only one of many crop combinations that either exist or could be developed. Our knowledge of the ecological mechanisms of interference that function in this crop community provides a tantalizing indication of what we can look for in mixtures anywhere farming

occurs.

An enormous number of polycultures exist, reflecting the wide variety of crops and management practices that farmers around the world use to meet their requirements for food, fiber, feed, fuel, forage, cash, and other needs. Intercrop communities can include mixtures of annuals, annuals with perennials, or perennials with perennials. Legumes can be grown with an array of cereals, and vegetable crops may be grown in between rows of fruit trees. The patterns of planting such mixtures can range from alternating rows of two crops to complex assortments of annual herbs, shrubs, and trees, as found in home garden agroecosystems (see Chapter 18). Planting and harvesting in polycultures can be distributed in both time and space to provide advantage to the farmer throughout the year. The integration of animals helps form even more fully integrated mixed crop communities (see Chapter 19). Understanding the ecological foundation of the interactions that take place in these crop communities is the key to returning polyculture to prominence in agricultural practice.

**USING SPECIES INTERACTIONS**

**FOR SUSTAINABILITY**

In natural ecosystems, organisms occur in communities of mixed species assemblages. Our ability to understand the complexity of interactions going on in such mixtures has benefited greatly from a growing body of ecological knowledge focused at each of the four levels of organization in ecosystems. The community ecology level discussed in this chapter is based on an understanding of the individual organism level and the population level. At the community level of organization, unique qualities begin to emerge as a result of multispecies interactions. These qualities have importance at the ecosystem level, as we will see in following chapters.

The challenge for agroecologists, then, is to put this ecological understanding into the context of sustainability. It is important that we combine the agronomists’ extensive knowledge of the ecology and management of single-species populations of crops with the ecologists’ extensive knowledge of species interactions and community processes. It is time to redirect a large portion of the resources that have generated all of the knowledge about single-species cropping systems toward the integration of both ecological and agronomic knowledge, and to do so with the broader goal of developing the ability to manage the entire community of interacting organisms, both crop and noncrop, and understand how each species contributes to the sustainability of the whole system. This is an extremely complex process, requiring a systemslevel approach and the interaction of many disciplines, but the end result will be a better understanding of how effective change in agriculture can come about.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. What are some of the primary impediments to con vincing farmers of the potential advantages of managing complex, multispecies cropping systems? 2. Give an example of a complex cropping community

where competition and mutualisms may play different but equally important roles in the success of the entire crop system. 3. Describe an example of how coexistence and mutu alisms in a crop community can be essential to the success of a biological control mechanism for a particular crop pest. 4. A noncrop organism can have either positive or neg ative impacts on the rest of the crop community of which it is a member. Explain how this is possible. 5. Describe a complex cropping community of crop

and noncrop populations that allows for a significant reduction in the use of nonrenewable synthetic agricultural chemicals. Be sure to explain the contribution made by each member of the crop community. 6. What are several “emergent qualities” of a crop

community that are not evident at the population or single individual level in an agroecosystem?
