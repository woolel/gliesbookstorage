## 23. Indicators of Sustainability

What is a sustainable agroecosystem? In Chapter 1 we
answered this question by saying that a sustainable agroecosystem is one that maintains the resource base upon
which it depends, relies on a minimum of artificial inputs
from outside the farm system, manages pests and diseases
through internal regulating mechanisms, and is able to
recover from the disturbances caused by cultivation and
harvest.

Although highly valuable, this is only a definition of a
sustainable agroecosystem—and a broad and formal one
at that. It is a different matter to point to an actually existing agroecosystem and identify it as sustainable or not
and determine why, or to specify exactly how to build a
sustainable system in a particular bioregion and sociocultural context. Generating the knowledge and expertise for
doing so is one of the main tasks facing the science of agroecology today, and is the subject to which this chapter is
devoted.


Ultimately, sustainability is a test of time: an agroecosystem that has continued to be productive and support local
livelihoods for a long period of time without degrading its
resource base—either locally or elsewhere—can be said to
be sustainable. But just what constitutes “a long period of
time” How is it determined if degradation of resources has
occurred? What tells us that all the components of the system
are healthy and viable? How well integrated are the social
and ecological components of sustainability? And how can a
sustainable system be designed when the proof of its sustainability remains always in the future?

Despite these challenges, we need to determine what
sustainability entails. In short, the task is to identify parameters of sustainability—specific characteristics of agroecosystems that play key parts in agroecosystem function—and
to determine at what level or condition, and for how long,
these parameters must be maintained for sustainable function to occur. Through this process, we can identify what
we will call indicators of sustainability—agroecosystemspecific conditions necessary for and indicative of sustainability. With such knowledge it will be possible to predict
whether or not a particular agroecosystem can be sustained
over the long term, and to design agroecosystems that have
the best chance of proving to be sustainable. This knowledge will also help us work to change the external forces
that have kept most agroecosystems from being sustainable
in the first place—a key part of transforming the entire food

system.



**LEARNING FROM EXISTING**

**SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS**


The process of identifying the elements of sustainability
begins with two kinds of existing systems: natural ecosystems and traditional agroecosystems. Both have stood the
test of time in terms of maintaining productivity over long
periods, and each offers a different kind of knowledge foundation. Natural ecosystems provide important reference
points, or benchmarks, for understanding the ecological basis
of sustainability; traditional agroecosystems offer abundant
examples of actually sustainable agricultural practices as
well as insights into how social systems—cultural, political,
and economic—fit into the sustainability equation. Based
on the knowledge gained from these systems, agroecological research can devise principles, practices, and designs that
can be applied in converting unsustainable industrial agroecosystems into sustainable ones.


**N** **atural** **E** **cosystems** **as** **R** **eference** **P** **oints**


As discussed in Chapter 2, natural ecosystems and industrial
agroecosystems are very different. The latter are generally
more productive but far less diverse than the former. And
unlike natural systems, industrial agroecosystems are far
from self-sustaining. Their productivity can be maintained
only with large additional inputs of energy and materials
from external, human-produced sources; otherwise they
quickly degrade to a much less productive level. In every
respect, these two types of systems are at opposite ends of

a spectrum.

The key to sustainability is to find a compromise between
the two—a system that models the structure and function of
natural ecosystems yet yields a harvest for human use. Such a
system is manipulated to a high degree by humans for human
ends, and is therefore not _self_ -sustaining, but relies on natural processes for maintenance of its productivity. Its resemblance to natural systems allows the system to sustain, over
the long term, human appropriation of its biomass without
large subsidies of industrial cultural energy and without detrimental effects on the surrounding environment.

Table 23.1 compares these three types of systems in terms
of several ecological criteria. As the terms in the table indicate, sustainable agroecosystems model the high diversity,
resilience, and autonomy of natural ecosystems. Compared
to industrial systems, they may have somewhat lower and

more variable yields, a reflection of the variation that occurs
from year to year in nature. These lower yields, however, are
usually more than offset by the advantage gained in reduced
dependence on external inputs and an accompanying reduction in adverse environmental impacts.

From this comparison we can derive a general principle:
_the greater the structural and functional similarity of an_
_agroecosystem to the natural ecosystems in its biogeographic_
_region, the greater the likelihood that the agroecosystem will_
_be sustainable_ . If this principle holds true, then observable
and measurable values for a range of natural ecosystem processes, structures, and rates can provide threshold values, or
benchmarks, that describe or delineate the ecological potential for the design and management of agroecosystems in a
particular area. It is the task of research to determine how
close an agroecosystem needs to be for these benchmark values to be sustainable (Gliessman 2001).

Throughout much of the rural world today, traditional agricultural practices and knowledge continue to form the basis
for much of the primary food production. What distinguishes
traditional and indigenous production systems from industrial systems is that the former developed primarily in times
or places where inputs other than human labor and local
resources were not available, or where alternatives have
been found that reduce, eliminate, or replace the energyand technology-intensive human inputs common to much of
present-day industrial agriculture. The knowledge embodied
in traditional systems reflects experience gained from past



generations, yet continues to develop in the present as the
ecological and cultural environments of the people involved
go through the continual process of adaptation and change
(Wilken 1988; González Jácome and Del Amo Rodriguez
1999; González Jácome 2011) (Figure 23.1).

Many traditional farming systems can allow for the satisfaction of local needs while also contributing to food
demands on the regional or national level. Production takes
place in ways that focus more on the long-term sustainability
of the system, rather than solely on maximizing yield and
profit. Traditional agroecosystems have been in use for a long
time, and during that time have gone through many changes

and adaptations. The fact that they still are in use is strong
evidence for a social and ecological stability that modern,
mechanized systems could well envy (Klee 1980).

Studies of traditional agroecosystems can contribute
greatly to the development of ecologically sound management practices. Indeed, our understanding of sustainability
in ecological terms comes mainly from knowledge generated
from such study (Koohafkan and Altieri 2010).

What are the characteristics of traditional agroecosystems
that make them sustainable? Despite the diversity of these
agroecosystems across the globe, we can begin to answer this
question by examining what most traditional systems have in
common. Traditional agroecosystems


  - Do not depend on external, purchased inputs

  - Make extensive use of locally available and renew
able resources

  - Emphasize the recycling of nutrients

  - Have beneficial or minimal negative impacts on

both the on- and off-farm environment

  - Are adapted to or tolerant of local conditions, rather

than dependent on massive alteration or control of
the environment

  - Are able to take advantage of the full range of

microenvironmental variation within the cropping
system, farm, and region

  - Maximize yield without sacrificing the long-term

productive capacity of the entire system and the
ability of humans to use its resources optimally

 - Maintain spatial and temporal diversity and

continuity

  - Conserve biological and cultural diversity

  - Rely on local crop varieties and often incorporate

wild plants and animals

  - Use production to meet local needs first

  - Are relatively independent of external economic

factors

  - Are built on the knowledge and culture of local

inhabitants


Traditional practices cannot be transplanted directly into
regions of the world where agriculture has already been
“modernized”, nor can industrial agriculture be converted
to fit the traditional mold exactly. Nevertheless, traditional
practices and agroecosystems hold important lessons for how
modern sustainable agroecosystems should be designed. A
sustainable system need not have all these outlined characteristics, but it must be designed so that all the functions of
these characteristics are retained.


If we are to use traditional agroecosystems as a model for
designing modern sustainable systems, we must understand
the traditional agroecosystems at all levels of their organization, from the individual crop plants or animals in the field
to the food production region or beyond. The examples of
traditional practices and methods presented throughout this
book provide an important starting point for the process of
understanding how ecological sustainability is achieved.



Traditional agroecosystems can also provide important
lessons about the role that social systems play in sustainability. For an agroecosystem to be sustainable, the cultural
and economic systems in which its human participants are
embedded must support and encourage sustainable practices
and not create pressures that undermine them. The importance of this connection is revealed when formerly sustainable traditional systems undergo changes that make them
unsustainable or environmentally destructive. In every case,
the underlying cause is some kind of social, cultural, or economic pressure. For example, it is a common occurrence for
traditional farmers to shorten fallow periods or increase their
herds of grazing animals in response to higher rents or other
economic pressures and to have these changes cause soil erosion or reduction in soil fertility. We will devote more attention to the link between social systems and sustainability in
Section VI.


It is essential that traditional agroecosystems be recognized as examples of sophisticated, applied ecological
knowledge. Otherwise, the so-called modernization process in agriculture will continue to destroy the time-tested
knowledge they embody—knowledge that should serve as
a starting point for the conversion to the more sustainable
agroecosystems of the future.


**DEFINING AND MEASURING**

**AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY**


If we are concerned about maintaining the productivity of
our food production systems over the long term, we need
to be able to distinguish between systems that remain temporarily productive because of their high levels of inputs
or external subsidies, and those that can remain productive indefinitely. This involves being able to _predict_ where
a system is headed—how its productivity will change in the
future. We can do this through analysis of agroecosystem
processes and conditions in the present.

A central question involves how a system’s ecological parameters are changing over time. Are the ecological
foundations of system productivity being maintained or
enhanced, or are they being degraded in some way? An agroecosystem that will someday become unproductive gives us
numerous hints of its future condition. Despite continuing
to give acceptable yields, its underlying foundation is being
destroyed. Its topsoil may be gradually eroding year by year;
salts may be accumulating; the diversity of its soil biota may
be declining. Inputs of fertilizers and pesticides may mask
these signs of degradation, but they are there nonetheless for
the farmer or agroecological researcher to detect. In contrast,
a sustainable agroecosystem will show no signs of underlying
degradation. Its topsoil depth will hold steady or increase; the
diversity of its soil biota will remain consistently high.

Equally important is the question of the maintenance of
farmer, farm family, and farm community livelihoods. Are
the elements of social health and welfare being maintained
so that farm families are able to enjoy a dignified, healthy life
with opportunities for education, personal growth, and food


**290** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



security? Even if economic returns hold steady in a region,
individual farmers may have to leave farming, children may
be taken out of school to work on the farm, or local opportunities for employment may be reduced. Reducing the number
of crops to meet market requirements or hiring undocumented labor at lower salaries and benefits may mask these
signs, and an integrated analysis is necessary to detect them.
A sustainable agroecosystem will show health and happiness
in all segments of the social fabric of the food system.

In practice, distinguishing between systems that are
degrading their foundations and those that are not is not as
straightforward as it may seem. A multitude of ecological and
social parameters, all interacting, determine sustainability—
considering each one independently or relying on only a
few may prove misleading. Moreover, some parameters are
more critical than others, and gains in one area may compensate for losses in another. A challenge for agroecological
research is to learn how the parameters interact and to determine their relative importance (Gliessman 1990, 1995, 2001;
Giampietro 2004).

In addition, analysis of agroecosystem sustainability
or unsustainability can be applied in a variety of ways.
Researchers or farmers may want to do any of the following,
alone or in combination:


  - Provide evidence of unsustainability on an individ
ual farm in order to motivate changes in the practices on that farm.

 - Provide evidence of the unsustainability of

industrial/conventional practices or systems more
generally to argue for changes in agricultural policy
or societal values regarding agriculture.

  - Predict how long a system can remain productive.

 - Prescribe specific ways of averting produc
tive collapse short of complete redesign of the

agroecosystem.

  - Prescribe ways of converting to a sustainable path

through complete agroecosystem redesign.


**TABLE 23.2**

**Indicators of Soil Health**




  - Develop supportive and equitable social relation
ships throughout the system.

  - Suggest ways of restoring or regenerating a degraded


agroecosystem.


Although these applications of sustainability analysis overlap, each represents a different focus and requires a different
kind of research approach.


**A** **ssessment** **of** **S** **oil** **H** **ealth**


In Chapters 8 and 9, we discussed the many ways that farmers can manage soil factors. Depending on a farmer’s skill
and experience, this management can lead to improvement, degradation, or maintenance of the soil conditions
needed to maintain both production and the qualities that
promote it.

The overall picture of the condition of the soil—the soil’s
fitness to support crop growth without degradation—is called
**soil health** . This term is frequently used interchangeably
with _soil quality_, although the two terms are often defined
somewhat differently. The methods that soil scientists have
developed to determine soil quality are usually fairly technical, costly, and laboratory based. They tell us a great deal
about the potential of any particular soil for farming or the
impacts of various farming, practices on the soil, but they
are impractical for farmers to use regularly. Farmers prefer
to describe soil health subjectively and qualitatively, using
words related to how the soil looks, feels, and smells. In this
way they are able to assess characteristics such as ease of
cultivation, water-holding capacity, organic matter content,
and potential for weed growth. Soil scientists have been
able to correlate these subjective determinations with their
quantitative analysis of soil quality, and they have developed
scorecards for assessing soil health on this basis (Magdoff
and van Es 2009).

Table 23.2 offers a fairly comprehensive set of soil health
indicators that can be tested easily on the farm. Most are



**Indicator** **Best Time to Test** **Healthy Condition**


Earthworm presence Spring or fall, when soil is moist Greater than 10 worms/ft [3] ; many castings and holes in tilled clods.

Color of organic matter When soil is moist Topsoil distinctly darker than subsoil.

Presence of plant residues Anytime Residue apparent on most of soil surface.

Condition of plant roots Late spring or during rapid growth Roots extensively branched, white, extended into subsoil.

Degree of subsurface compaction Before tillage or after harvest A stiff wire goes in easily to 2× plow depth.

Soil tilth or friability When soil is moist Soil crumbles easily, feels spongy when walked on.
Signs of erosion After heavy rainfall No gullies or rills; runoff from fields is clear.

Water-holding capacity After rainfall during growing season Soil holds moisture well more than a week w/o signs of drought stress.
Degree of water infiltration After rainfall No ponding or runoff; soil surface does not remain excessively wet.

pH At same time each year Near neutral and appropriate for crop.

Nutrient-holding capacity At same time each year N, P, and K trending up, but not into _very high_ zone.

One important aspect of sustainability analysis is to use a
more holistic basis for analyzing an agroecosystem’s most
basic process—the production of biomass. Industrial agriculture is concerned with this process in terms of yield. How the
harvest output, or **production**, is created is not important as
long as the production is as high as possible. For sustainable
agroecosystems, however, measurement of production alone
is not adequate because the goal is sustainable production.
Attention must be paid to the _processes_ that enable production. This means focusing on **productivity** —the set of processes and structures actively chosen and maintained by the
farmer to produce the harvest.

From an ecological perspective, productivity is a process
in ecosystems that involves the capture of light energy and
its transformation into biomass. Ultimately, it is this biomass
that supports the processes of sustainable production. In a
sustainable agroecosystem, therefore, the goal is to optimize
the process of productivity so as to ensure the highest yield
possible without causing environmental degradation, rather
than to strive for maximum yields at all costs. If the processes of productivity are ecologically sound, sustainable
production will follow.

One way of quantifying productivity is to measure the
amount of biomass invested in the harvested product in relation to the total amount of standing biomass present in the
rest of the system. This is done through the use of the **pro-**
**ductivity index** _(PI)_, represented by the following formula:


_Total biomass accumulated in_



_Productivity index (PI)_



= _the system_
_Ne_ _**t**_ _primary productivity (NPP)_



The PI provides a way of measuring the potential for an agroecosystem to sustainably produce a harvestable yield. It can
be a valuable tool in both the design and the evaluation of
sustainable agroecosystems. A PI value can be used as an
indicator of sustainability if we assume that there is a positive
correlation between the return of biomass to an agroecosystem and the system’s ability to provide harvestable yield.

The value of the PI will vary between a low of 1 for the
most extractive annual cropping system, to a high of about
50 in some natural ecosystems, especially ecosystems in
the early stages of succession. The higher the PI of a system, the greater its ability to maintain a certain harvest output. For an intensive annual cropping system, the threshold
value for sustainability is 2. At this level, the amount of biomass returned to the system each season is equal to what is
removed as yield, which is the same as saying that half of the
biomass produced during the season is harvested, and half
returned to the system.

Net primary productivity (NPP) does not vary much
between system types (it ranges from 0 to 30 tons/ha/year);



**FIGURE 23.2** **The traditional Chinese home garden agroeco-**
**system, with pond, paddy, and vegetable beds.** The continual
return of all forms of organic matter to the agroecosystem maintains a high PI.


what really varies from system to system is standing biomass
(it ranges between 0 and 800 tons/ha). When a larger portion
of NPP is allowed to accumulate as biomass or standing crop,
the PI increases and so does the ability to harvest biomass
without compromising sustainable system functioning. One
way of increasing the standing biomass of the system is to
combine annuals and perennials in some alternating pattern
in time and space (Figure 23.2).

To be able to apply the PI in the most useful manner, we
must find answers to a number of questions: How can higher
ratios be sustained over time? How is the ratio of the return

of biomass to the amount of biomass harvested connected to

the process of productivity? What is the relationship between
standing crop or biomass in an agroecosystem, and the ability to remove biomass as harvest or yield?


**E** **cological** **C** **onditions** **of** **S** **ustainable** **F** **unction**


The ecological framework that has been described in this
book provides us with a set of ecological parameters that
can be studied and monitored over time to assess movement

toward or away from sustainability. These parameters include
such things as species diversity, organic matter content of the
soil, and topsoil depth. For each parameter, agroecological
theory suggests a general type of condition or quality that
is necessary for sustainable functioning of the system—such
as high diversity, high organic matter content, and thick topsoil. The specific rates, levels, values, and statuses of these
parameters that together indicate a condition of sustainability, however, will vary for each agroecosystem because of
differences in farm type, resources used, local climate, and
other site-specific variables. Each system, therefore, must be
studied separately to generate sets of system-specific indicators of sustainability.

The parameters listed in Table 23.3 provide a framework
for research focusing on what is required for sustainable
function of an agroecosystem from an ecological perspective.

Indicators of Sustainability **293**

more detail on its importance and how it might be measured.


**S** **ocial** **C** **onditions** **of** **S** **ustainable** **F** **unction**


Agriculture has been overly focused on the narrow economic
goals of raising yields and increasing the returns on investments. When we use the criteria of sustainability, it is clear
that the quality of life for the people involved in agriculture
must also be taken into account, observed, and monitored
over time. Social health, like soil health, is a composite picture of many factors, or parameters. These parameters include
physical health and emotional well-being for individuals, and
equity, participation, social function, and democratic expression for the family and community.

For each parameter, we can integrate agroecological
concepts and social theory grounded in rural sociology
to arrive at a general condition that reflects social health.
For individuals, we can measure such factors as educational attainment, incidence of drug and alcohol abuse, and
overall physical health. For families and communities, we
can assess characteristics such as changes in the number
of farms in the area, average income per farm, number of
farm-related businesses, and level of participation in farmer
networks. As for ecological parameters, social parameters have specific rates, levels, values, and relations that
together indicate a condition of sustainability; however, due
to the great differences in culture, history, relationships,
and belief systems, these indicators are more subjective
and location specific. Since the evaluator of sustainability
cannot put his or her values on the people or communities
being evaluated, participatory approaches to measurement
are important (Bacon 2005).

Some important social and economic parameters related
to agroecosystem and regional food-system sustainability
are listed in Table 23.4. This is not an exhaustive list. The

social framework for sustainability is discussed in more
detail in Section VI, and the reader is referred to the section
Recommended Readings for more depth and information.


**RESEARCH ON SUSTAINABILITY**


Research on the sustainability of agroecosystems has grown
considerably since the 1990s (Gliessman 2001; Turner et al.
2003; Zhen and Routray 2003; Astier et al. 2008; Firth et al.
2008; Bohlen and Swain 2009; Ellsworth and Feenstra 2010).
The principles on which sustainability can be built are well
established (and have been discussed in detail in this text),
and recent work in the field has generated much of the more
detailed knowledge needed to apply these principles to the
design of sustainable systems and the global conversion of
agriculture to sustainability.

Much more research still needs to be done because the

resources and efforts of agricultural research have long been
concentrated on other concerns. Research has focused on

maximizing production, studying the component parts of
systems, evaluating results based primarily on short-term
economic return, answering questions involving immediate
production problems, and serving the immediate needs and
demands of agriculture as an independent industry (Pretty
2002; Roberts 2008). The result has been the development
of a high-yielding, industrial agriculture that is experiencing
great difficulty responding to concerns about environmental
quality, resource conservation, food safety, the quality of
rural life, and the sustainability of agriculture itself.

In recent years, however, the emphasis in agriculture has
begun to shift from maximizing yields and profit over the
short term to valuing the ability to sustain productivity over
the long term. Reflecting this shift, the number of university
programs, nonprofit organizations, and development projects
with a sustainability focus has grown substantially. There has
also been a remarkable emergence of a range of certification
programs around the world, from organic to environmentally
friendly to fairly traded to food justice certified. The need to
fully understand the indicator concept and how to apply it has
become a high priority.

The emerging agroecological approach permits research to
apply an integrated system-level framework concerned with
management for the long term (Gliessman 2001; Rickerl
and Francis 2004; Bohlen and House 2009). Agroecological
research studies the environmental background of the agroecosystem, as well as the complex of processes involved in


**294** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



the maintenance of long-term productivity. It establishes the
ecological basis of sustainability in terms of resource use
and conservation, including soil, water, genetic resources,
and air quality. Then it examines the interactions between
the many organisms of the agroecosystem, beginning with
interactions at the individual species level and culminating
at the ecosystem level as the dynamics of the entire system
are revealed.


The ecological concepts and principles on which agroecology is based establish a holistic perspective for the
design and management of sustainable agricultural systems.
The application of ecological methods is essential for determining (1) if a particular agricultural practice, input, or management decision is sustainable, and (2) what the ecological
basis is for the functioning of the chosen management strategy over the long term.

The holistic perspective of agroecology means that
instead of focusing research on very limited problems or
single variables in a production system, these problems or
variables are studied as part of a larger unit. There is little
doubt that certain problems require research specialization.
But in agroecological studies any necessary narrow focus is
placed in the context of the larger system. Impacts that are
felt outside of the production unit as a result of a particular
management strategy (e.g., a reduction in local biodiversity)
can be part of agroecological analysis. This broadening of
the research context extends to the social realm as well—
the final step in agroecological research is to understand
ecological sustainability in the context of social and economic systems.


**Q** **uantification** **of** **S** **ustainability**


For agroecological research to contribute to making agriculture more sustainable, it must establish a framework for measuring and quantifying sustainability (Liverman et al. 1988;
Gliessman 2001; Ellsworth and Feenstra 2010). We need to
be able to assess a particular system to determine how far
from sustainability it is, which of its aspects are least sustainable, exactly how its sustainability is being undermined, and
how it can be changed to move it toward sustainable functioning. And once a system is designed with the intent of being
sustainable, we need to be able to monitor it to determine if
sustainable functioning has been achieved.

The methodological tools for accomplishing this task can
be borrowed from the science of ecology. Ecology has a welldeveloped set of methodologies for the quantification of ecosystem characteristics such as nutrient cycling, energy flow,
population dynamics, species interactions, and habitat modification. Using these tools, agroecosystem characteristics—
and how they are impacted by humans—can be studied from
a level as specific as that of an individual species to a level as
broad as that of the global environment.

We can also borrow methodological tools from rural
and environmental sociologists who have developed a set of
methodologies for evaluation of societal characteristics such
as access to economic resources, social networks, political



or economic status, and empowerment. Using these tools,
broader agroecosystem characteristics—and how they are
affected by political and economic structures and relationships—can be studied from a level as specific as a household
to a level as broad as that of global markets and free trade

agreements.

One approach is to analyze specific agroecosystems or
food-system issues to quantify at what level a particular
ecological or social parameter or set of parameters must
be at for sustainable function to occur. Many researchers
are doing work in this area, and some of their results are
presented in Table 23.5. Even though the results are given
individually, it is important to remember that such results
must be used and interpreted in the context of the whole
system and the complex of interacting factors of which they
are only a part.

Another kind of approach is to begin with the whole
system. Some researchers, for example, have been working on developing methods for determining the probability
of an agroecosystem being sustainable over the long term
(Hansen and Jones 1996; Vilain 2003). Using a systems
framework for measuring the carrying capacity of a particular landscape, they apply a methodology for integrating
the rates of change of a range of parameters of sustainability
and determine how quickly change is taking place toward
or away from a specific goal. Such an analysis is limited
by the difficulty of choosing which parameters to integrate
into the model, but has the potential for becoming a tool
allowing us to predict if a system will be able to continue
indefinitely or not.

Comparative analysis of multiple farms or farming
systems is yet another means of assessing sustainability.
Comparing a broad range of ecological and economic factors
derived from the simultaneous study of contrasting farming
systems over several years, especially when industrial and
alternative practices are involved, will show factor differentiation through time (e.g., Gliessman et al. 1996). Correlating
factor levels with crop performance can give indications of
sustainability.

Survey instruments such as interviews and questionnaires
can also be applied to multiple farms and farmers, with a
set of parameters of sustainability being used to gain a bigger picture of the relationship between farm performance
and farmer practice. For example, Pretty et al. (2003) carried out a survey of over 208 agroecologically based projects
and initiatives in 52 developing countries involving almost
9 million farmers on 28.9 million hectares of land in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America. By using the promoted agroecologically based practices, yields were increased by 48%–93%
per hectare. The surveys were able to correlate these yield
increases over several years with one of four mechanisms:
(1) intensification of a single component of a farm system;
(2) addition of a new productive element to a farm system;
(3) better use of water and land to increase cropping intensity; or (4) introduction of new agroecological elements into
farm systems and new locally appropriate crop varieties and
animal breeds. The surveys allowed the farmers to tell their

Another valuable foundation for doing sustainability analysis of farming systems takes advantage of multiple, diverse,
and often dispersed data sets that are connected to agriculture in a given region. For example, the New Mainstream
Project of the Roots of Change in California assembled
an immense data set for current California food systems.
Information that ranged from water use, number of farms,
farm gate production values, number of farmers’ markets,
and pesticide use was gathered from multiple agencies and
organizations connected to agriculture and food issues. Data
sets for some factors came from many years of data gathering
and have considerable quantitative validity. They were used
to project forward into the future the kinds of changes that
might be needed to offset negative trends, or to promote more
sustainable activities, practices, or policies. These data sets,
however, were limited in two ways: they were focused on the
current food system, not the one we want to move toward,
and they were not very well integrated and able to give a full
view of how the component parts of a sustainable food system might be assembled.

An approach that can begin to overcome this problem
and better integrate the separate parameters of sustainability is the MESMIS system for evaluating natural resource
management systems, developed by Masera and others in



Mexico (Masera and Lopéz-Ridaura 2000). Indicators are
chosen, ideal values for each are determined, and two or
more systems are analyzed to determine how close, in percentage terms, each aspect of the system comes to the ideal
value set for its indicator. The result is an “amoeba” dia
gram, or radar graph, like the one shown in Figure 23.3.
The assumption is that the greater the percentage of the
optimal area covered by an amoeba the higher the level of
sustainability of the agroecosystem it represents. Areas of
relative strength and weakness can thereby be compared.
This system can be used to show how close each indicator is
to a theoretically ideal value, offering a measure of progress
toward sustainable function. Both qualitative and quantitative measures can be used. In addition, when applied in a
participatory action research setting, the farm community
is a partner in selecting the galaxy of indicators that are of
greatest concern or most interest for the comparison. The
results are highly variable in terms of which factors are chosen to make the multiple axes, but this method enables a
simple, yet comprehensive comparison of the systems being
evaluated.


An advanced and complex analysis of indicators of agroecosystem sustainability has been developed by Giampietro
(2004). He employs all of the methodologies described
throughout this chapter, and then some, to create what he
calls multi-scale integrated analysis. This methodology

applies complex system theory, integrates diverse components that cut across the ecological and social realms, and
takes into account change through time over different scales.
The results are layered with multiple scales of uncertainty,
change, location, and cultural preference. Overall, this
methodology calls attention to the need to move beyond the
reductionist tendency of looking at single factors affecting
sustainability.

The growing number of research studies on sustainability
indicators, along with the increasing number of certification
programs oriented toward giving consumers a better basis
for making choices in the market place, has fostered some
attempts to tackle the very difficult task of standardizing the
components of sustainability. The members of the Leonardo
Academy, who promote themselves as “the sustainability
experts”, have been leading a several-year project to develop
a single certification standard for agricultural products in
the US market place (see section Internet Resources). At
the global level, a nonprofit connected to the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization called the Committee
on Sustainability Assessment (COSA) has been engaged in
developing global standards of sustainability. COSA has
developed several hundred indicators that cover ecological, economic, and social components of food systems from
around the world. They have a primary focus on informing
policy decisions in the sustainable development work of the
United Nations (see section Internet Resources). For any of
these large efforts to be successful and have a positive impact
on food-system change, it will be essential to integrate
research, practice, and social needs for change.

One of the weaknesses of conventional agricultural
research is the way in which the narrowness of its focus on
production problems has ignored the social and economic
impacts of agricultural modernization. Agroecological
research cannot make the same mistake. In addition to

paying greater attention to the ecological foundation
upon which agriculture ultimately depends, agroecological research must understand agriculture within its social
and economic context. Understanding agroecosystems as
social–ecological systems will permit the evaluation of
such qualities of agroecosystems as the long-term effects
of different input/output strategies, the importance of the
human element to production, and the relationship between
economic and ecological components of sustainable agroecosystem management. Developing this knowledge
becomes an important part of moving beyond the level of
the farm and the farm community to the food system as a
whole and beginning to take the steps necessary to transform this system into one that works toward the goal of
sustainability, broadly defined.

**CASE STUDY: SUSTAINABILITY IN A CHINESE VILLAGE AGROECOSYSTEM**

Although it is often easy to identify processes that are degrading a system, it is much more difficult to determine what
processes are necessary for sustainable productivity. Because the term “sustainable” describes a managed system that
will maintain productivity over an indefinite period of time, it is difficult to find indicators of sustainability that can be
measured over the short term.


One way to look for these indicators is to study systems that have a track record, systems that have sustained constant
production of food for human consumption over a long period of time without degrading their ecological foundations.
Many types of traditional agriculture around the world meet this requirement, but their relevance for the study of ecological sustainability is limited because their yields are much lower than those of modern systems. This is not so for
village agroecosystems in the Tai Lake region of China, located in the Yangtze River Delta. Sustained high yields under
intensive human management have been documented in this area for more than nine centuries. The suitability of these
systems for study of sustainability attracted researcher Erle Ellis in the 1990s.

Since traditional management practices have now in part been supplanted by modern practices, Ellis looked at the
history of the region’s agriculture, examining a multitude of factors, including landscape features, climate, soils, and
human management practices. In order to elucidate the ecological mechanisms underlying the sustainability of the area’s
agriculture, Ellis studied the cycling of nutrients at the level of an entire village. This scale of study allowed him to
compensate for the variability that exists between the practices of individual farmers and the variability of the landscape,
and thereby draw more accurate conclusions. It also enabled him to discern overall processes that might be invisible at
the field level.

With evidence suggesting that nitrogen was the limiting factor in traditional Chinese agroecosystems, Ellis made
the cycling and management of this nutrient the focus of his research. He identified the specific practices and natural
processes in the system that historically maintained adequate levels of soil nitrogen in the absence of inputs of inorganic
fertilizer.

Ellis identified several aspects of traditional management practices that he believes were essential in maintaining
nitrogen fertility (Ellis and Wang 1997). One of the most important of these was the use of natural inputs, such as sediments from local waterways. Biological nitrogen fixation also played a significant role. A third factor, perhaps the most
important, was the thorough recycling of organic matter. Nearly all organic wastes—including human excrement—were
recycled in the village system, by either being returned to the fields directly or composted and then returned. Another
important contributor to sustainability was the integration of animals to create a cyclical nutrient flow: farmers raised
pigs specifically for their manure, and a portion of the animals’ diet was food and agricultural waste.

Although these practices continue, they have been largely replaced by the application of inorganic fertilizers. This
change, initiated in the 1960s, has made nitrogen a problematic source of pollution instead of a limiting nutrient. Although
the use of inorganic inputs has boosted productivity even higher, feeding an ever-growing population, this change in
management makes the continued sustainability of the region’s agricultural systems an open question.
