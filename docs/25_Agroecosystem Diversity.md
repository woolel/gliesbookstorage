## 17. Agroecosystem Diversity

Both agroecosystems and natural ecosystems are made up of
organisms and the nonliving physical environment in which
the organisms live. The three preceding chapters have been
concerned primarily with the organismal, or biotic, components of these systems, at the level of populations and
communities. In this chapter, we begin to add the abiotic
components of ecosystems to the picture, thereby reaching
the ecosystem level of study. At this level, we look at systems
as wholes, gaining a more complete picture of their structure
and functioning.

The complexity that characterizes whole systems is the
basis for ecological interactions that are a crucial foundation
for sustainable agroecosystem design. These interactions are
largely a function of the _diversity_ of a system.

Diversity is at once a product, a measure, and a foundation of a system’s complexity and therefore, of its ability
to support sustainable functioning. From one perspective,
ecosystem diversity comes about as a result of the ways
that the different living and nonliving components of the
system are organized and interact. From another perspective, diversity—as manifested by the complex of biogeochemical cycles and the variety of living organisms—is
what makes the organization and interactions of the system
possible.

In this chapter, we first explore what it means to manage
agroecosystems as whole systems, taking advantage of their
emergent qualities. We then examine biodiversity in natural ecosystems, the value of diversity in an agroecosystem
setting, how diversity is evaluated, and the possible role of
island biogeography theory in managing diversity. Finally,
we explore the connections between ecological diversity and
sustainability in terms of developing a framework for agroecosystem design and management.


**WHOLE-SYSTEM APPROACHES**

**AND OPPORTUNITIES**


In the previous chapter, we saw how the interactions among
the populations of a crop community lead to emergent qualities that exist only at the community level. At the ecosystem level, another set of emergent qualities exist that make
the agroecosystem much greater than the sum of its parts
(or the farm much greater than the sum of the crop plants
in its fields). Management that works at this level can take
advantage of a huge array of beneficial interactions and

processes.



**M** **anaging** **the** **W** **hole** **S** **ystem**


Agroecology emphasizes the need to study both the parts and
the whole. Although the concept of the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts is widely recognized, it has been
ignored for a long time by modern agronomy and technology,
which emphasize the detailed study of the individual crop
plant or animal as a way of dealing with the complex issues
of farm production and viability. We have learned a great
deal from specialization and a narrow focus on the yield of
the crop components of farming systems, but an understanding of the entire farm (and the whole food system) must also
be developed to fully understand agricultural sustainability
and implement sustainable management practices.

When agroecosystem management considers the opportunities presented by the emergent qualities of whole systems, the paradigm of _controlling_ conditions and populations
is replaced by the paradigm of _managing_ them. Under the
management paradigm, we are always striving to consider
the effects on the whole system of any action or practice, and
we deliberately design practices that build on whole-system
functioning and emergent qualities.

Under the industrial approach, the attempt to rigidly control and homogenize all the conditions separately too often
results in the elimination of beneficial relationships and
interferences, leaving only negative interference and interactions. Industrial or conventional management practices work
primarily at the individual or population level of the system,
rather than at the community and ecosystem levels, where
more complex interactions can take place.

The problems inherent in the population-level, controloriented industrial approach are readily seen in the way it
has been applied to pest, weed, and pathogen control during the past several decades. Based on the principle that the
only good bug or weed is a dead one, an incredible array
of technologies have been developed to remove or eliminate
each target pest from the cropping system. These technologies have simplified agroecosystems in various ways—for
example, by eliminating the predators of the target pests. In
simplified agroecosystems, however, pest invasions become
more common and pernicious, and the use of external inputs
must increase to deal with the resulting problems.

The central priority in whole-system management is creating a more complex, diverse agroecosystem, because

**FIGURE 17.1** **System dynamics in diverse agroecosystems.**



only with high diversity is there a potential for beneficial
interactions. The farmer begins by increasing the number
of plant species in the system, through a variety of planting practices and principles that increase diversity as discussed in the rest of this chapter. Then livestock may be
integrated with the crops, as discussed in Chapter 19. This
diversification leads to positive changes in the abiotic conditions and attracts populations of beneficial arthropods
and other animals. Emergent qualities develop that allow
the system—with appropriate management of its specific
components—to function in ways that maintain fertility
and productivity and regulate pest populations. This very
general conceptualization of the dynamics of managing a
diverse agroecosystem is sketched out in Figure 17.1.

In a diverse and complex system, many if not all the challenges facing farmers can be met with appropriate management of system components and interactions, making the
addition of external inputs largely unnecessary. In the area
of pest management, for example, pest populations can be
controlled by system interactions intentionally set up by the
agroecosystem manager. In the area of nutrient cycling, as
another example, animals can convert plant matter humans
can’t consume into manure for use on the farm.


The many methods of “alternative” pest management
developed by organic farmers and agroecologists are a good
example of diversity-based whole-system management.
These methods rely on increasing agroecosystem diversity
and complexity as a foundation for establishing beneficial
interactions that keep pest populations in check. Descriptions



of several of these methods, as applied in specific agroecosystems, are presented in Table 17.1.


**ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY**


In ecology, the concept of diversity tends to be applied
mainly at the community level: diversity is understood as
the number of different species making up a community in
a particular location. Ecosystems, however, have other kinds
of variety and heterogeneity beyond that encompassed by the
number of species. They have diversity in the spatial arrangement of their components, for example, as shown by the different canopy levels in a forest. They have diversity in their
functional processes and diversity in the genomes of their
biota. And since they change in various ways over time, both
cyclically and directionally, they have what could be called
temporal diversity.

Diversity, therefore, has a variety of different _dimensions_ .
When these dimensions are recognized and defined, the concept of diversity itself is broadened and complexified—it
becomes what we will call **ecological diversity** .

Some of the possible dimensions of ecological diversity
are listed in Table 17.2. Other dimensions may be recognized
and defined, but these seven are the dimensions that will be
used in this text. (The term _biodiversity_ is commonly used to
refer to a combination of species diversity and genetic diversity.) These different dimensions of ecological diversity are
useful tools for fully understanding diversity in both natural
ecosystems and agroecosystems.

Diversity seems to be an inherent characteristic of most
natural ecosystems. Although the degree of diversity among
different ecosystems varies greatly, ecosystems in general
tend to express as great a diversity as possible given the constraints of their abiotic environments.


Diversity is in part a function of evolutionary dynamics.
As discussed in Chapter 15, mutation, genetic recombination,



and natural selection combine to produce variability, innovation, and differentiation among earth’s biota. Once diversity
is generated, it tends to be self-reinforcing. Greater species diversity leads to greater differentiation of habitats and
greater productivity, which in turn allow even greater species
diversity.

Diversity has an important role in maintaining ecosystem
structure and function. Ever since Tansley (1935) coined the
term “ecosystem” to refer to the combination of plant and
animal communities and their physical environment, ecologists have attempted to demonstrate the relationship between
the diversity of a system and its stability. Natural ecosystems generally conform to the principle that greater diversity allows greater resistance to perturbation and disturbance.
Ecosystems with high diversity tend to be more resilient—
to be able to recover from disturbance and restore balance
in their processes of material cycling and energy flow. In
ecosystems with low diversity, disturbance can more easily
cause permanent shifts in functioning, resulting in the loss
of resources from the ecosystem and changes in its species
makeup.


**Scale of Diversity**
The size of the area being considered has an impact on
how diversity (species diversity in particular) is measured.


**206** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems


**SPECIAL TOPIC:** _**RHIZOBIUM**_ **BACTERIA, LEGUMES, AND THE NITROGEN CYCLE**
One important way of taking advantage of ecological diversity is to introduce nitrogen-fixing legumes into the agroecosystem. As a result of the mutualistic relationship between the leguminous plants and bacteria of the genus _Rhizobium_,
nitrogen derived from the atmosphere is made available to all the biotic members of the system. The ability of a system
to supply its needs for nitrogen in this way is an emergent quality made possible by biotic diversity.

_Rhizobium_ bacteria possess the ability to capture atmospheric nitrogen from the air in the soil and convert it to a
form that is usable by the bacteria and also by plants. These bacteria can live freely in the soil; however, when legume
plants are present, the bacteria infect the plants’ root structure. A bacterium moves into an internal root cell, causing it
to differentiate and form a nodule in which the bacterium can reproduce. The bacteria in a root nodule begin to receive
all the sugars they need from the host plant, giving up their ability to live independently; they reciprocate by making the
nitrogen they fix available to the host. The interaction provides an advantage to both organisms: the plant is able to obtain
nitrogen that would otherwise not be available to it, and the bacteria are able to maintain a much higher population level
than they can in the soil. A great deal is that more nitrogen fixation occurs with nodulated legumes, therefore, than with
free-living _Rhizobium_ alone. When the host plant dies, the bacteria can revert to an autotrophic lifestyle and reenter the
soil community.

Because nitrogen is often a limiting nutrient, a legume’s relationship with _Rhizobium_ allows it to survive in soil that
may contain too little nitrogen to support other plants. And if the legume is returned to the soil after it dies, the bacterially
fixed nitrogen it incorporated into its biomass during its life becomes part of the soil, available for other plants to use.

This mutualism has been historically important in agriculture. The legume– _Rhizobium_ symbiosis is the primary
source of nitrogen addition in many traditional agroecosystems, and was one of the only methods used to incorporate
environmental nitrogen into many crop systems before the development of nitrogen fertilizer. Legume crops have been
intercropped with nonlegumes, as in the corn–bean–squash polyculture common in Latin America, and legumes are
used as covercrops and green manure crops in the United States and other regions to improve soil quality and nitrogen
content. Legumes have also been an important part of managed fallow systems. All of these systems take advantage of
the legume– _Rhizobium_ symbiosis, using biological nitrogen fixation to make usable nitrogen available to the entire plant
community, and ultimately to humans.



The species diversity of a single location in a river valley forest is different from the species diversity across the river valley’s different communities.

Species diversity in a single location is often called **alpha**
**diversity** . This is simply the variety of species in a relatively
small area of one community. Species diversity across communities or habitats—the variety of species from one location
to another—is called **beta diversity** . On a still larger scale
is **gamma diversity**, which is a measurement of the species
diversity of a region such as a mountain range or river valley.

The difference between the three types of diversity can
be illustrated with a hypothetical 5 km transect. It is possible to measure alpha diversity at any location along the
transect by counting the number of species within, say, 10 m
of a specified point. A measure of beta diversity, in contrast,
includes at least two points along the transect in different but
adjacent habitats. If the species makeup of these two locations is very different, beta diversity is high; if the species
makeup changes little as one moves between the two habitats, beta diversity is low. A measure of gamma diversity
is made along the entire length of the transect, taking into
account both the total number of species and the variation
in their distribution. In principle, the distinction between
alpha, beta, and gamma diversities can be extended to other
dimensions of ecological diversity, such as structural and
functional diversity.

Alpha, beta, and gamma diversities are helpful conceptual
distinctions because they allow us to describe how different



ecosystems and landscapes vary in the structure of their
diversity. For example, a highly diverse natural grassland
that stretches for hundreds of kilometers in every direction
is likely to have high alpha diversity, but since the same species in the same relative proportions are found at all locations
over a wide area, the grassland’s beta and gamma diversities
are relatively low. As a contrasting example, consider a landscape made up of a complex mosaic of simple communities,
such as nonnative grassland, a forest community dominated
by a single species, and a scrub community growing on steep
slopes. Alpha diversity is relatively low in each of the communities, but any transect across the area crosses a variety of
species groupings, making beta and gamma diversities relatively high.

The alpha and beta scales of diversity in particular have
useful application in agroecosystems. A cropping system
with high beta diversity, for example, can often provide the
same advantages as one with high alpha diversity while offering greater ease of management (Figure 17.2).


**Successional Processes and Changes in Diversity**
Studies of natural ecosystems in early stages of development
or following disturbance have shown that all the dimensions
of diversity tend to increase over time. This process takes
place through niche diversification, habitat modification,
competitive displacement, resource partitioning, and the
development of coexistence, mutualisms, and other forms
of interference. Variability and fluctuation in ecosystem

in that a locality could comprise many more crop plants; the point
of the diagram is to show the contrast between the two arrangements, which might represent (a) three crops planted in strips and
(b) an intercrop of the three crops.


processes are damped by this diversification, giving the system the appearance of greater stability as diversity increases.

When an ecosystem is disturbed, each of the dimensions
of its ecological diversity is simplified, or set back to an earlier stage of development. The number of species is reduced,
vertical stratification decreases, and fewer interactions occur.
Following the disturbance, the ecosystem begins the recovery process that is called secondary succession (see Chapter
18 for more detail). During this process, the system begins to
restore the diversity of species, interactions, and processes
that existed before disturbance.


Eventually the system reaches something called maturity, which might be defined as the successional condition
in which the full potential for energy flow, nutrient cycling,
and population dynamics in that physical environment can be
realized. The structural and functional diversity of the ecosystem at maturity provides resistance to change in the face
of further minor disturbance.


Even though diversity tends to increase through the stages of
succession, recent research in ecology indicates that maturity
may not represent the stage with the greatest diversity, at least
in terms of species. Rather, the greatest diversity is achieved as
a system approaches maturity, with diversity declining slightly
thereafter as full maturity is attained. Biomass continues to
increase at maturity, though at a slower rate (Figure 17.3).


**Diversity, Stability, and Resilience**
There has been considerable discussion in ecology about the
relationship between diversity and “stability.” There appears
to be some correlation between the two—that is, the greater
the diversity of an ecosystem, the more resistant it is to
change, and the better able it is to recover from disturbance—
but there is disagreement over the degree and strength of the
correlation.

**FIGURE 17.3** **Changes in species diversity and biomass dur-**

Much of the problem arises from the restricted nature of
the accepted definition of stability. “Stability” usually refers
to the relative absence of fluctuations in the populations of
organisms in the system, implying a steady-state condition,
or a lack of change. This notion of stability is inadequate,
especially in relation to describing the ecological results of
diversity. For this reason, the term _stability_ has been largely
replaced by the terms _resilience_ and _resistance_, as reflected in
the introductory discussion of ecosystem structure in Chapter
2. To review, resistance is the ability to resist change in general, and resilience is the ability to rebound from disturbance
and return to a state similar to that which existed before the

disturbance. In general, the diversity of a system is correlated
highly with both resistance and resilience.

For some ecologists, resistance and resilience don’t account
for all the related qualities that result from diversity. They
would like a concept that focuses on what might be called the
_robustness_ of an ecosystem, its ability to sustain complex levels of interaction and self-regulating processes of energy flow
and material cycling. Such a concept would be helpful in particular for understanding the value and use of diversity in agroecosystems, for which farmers and agroecosystem managers
seek something that goes beyond resistance and resilience.

To gain a better sense of what diversity generates in an ecosystem, we need more research into possible causal relationships among the different forms of ecological diversity and
specific ecosystem processes and characteristics. Some important work in this area has already been done. It has been found,
for example, that higher bird species diversity is correlated
with more complex community structure, because it supports
a greater variety of feeding and nesting behaviors. Similarly,
predator–prey diversity and a more complex food web are correlated with both actual species numbers and habitat diversity.


**E** **cological** **D** **iversity** **in** **A** **groecosystems**


In most agroecosystems, disturbance occurs much more frequently, regularly, and with greater intensity than it does in


**208** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



natural ecosystems. Rarely can agroecosystems proceed very
far in their successional development. As a result, diversity in
an agroecosystem is difficult to maintain.

The loss of diversity greatly weakens the tight functional
links between species that characterize natural ecosystems.
Nutrient cycling rates and efficiency change, energy flow is
altered, and dependence on human interference and inputs
increases. For these reasons, agroecosystems are considered
less resistant and less resilient than natural ecosystems.

Nevertheless, agroecosystems need not be as simplified
and diversity poor as industrial agroecosystems typically are.
Within the constraints imposed by the need for harvesting
biomass, agroecosystems can approach the level of diversity
exhibited by natural ecosystems, and enjoy the benefits of
the increased resilience, resistance, and robustness allowed
by greater diversity. Managing the complexity of interactions
that are possible when more of the elements of diversity are
present in the farm system is a key part of reducing the need
for external inputs and moving toward sustainability.


**Value of Agroecosystem Diversity**
A key strategy in sustainable agriculture is to reincorporate diversity into the agricultural landscape and manage
it more effectively. Increasing diversity is contrary to the
focus of much of present-day industrial-style agriculture,
which reaches its extreme form in large-scale monocultures.
It would appear that diversity is seen more as a liability in
such systems, especially when we consider all of the inputs
and practices that have been developed to limit diversity and
maintain uniformity.

Research on multiple cropping systems underscores the
great importance of diversity in an agricultural setting (Francis
1986; Vandermeer 1992; Altieri 1995b; Innis 1997; Ong et
al. 2004; Mohler and Stoner 2009; Volder and Franco 2013).
Diversity is of value in agroecosystems for a variety of reasons:


  - With higher diversity, there is greater microhabitat

differentiation, allowing the component species of
the system to become “habitat specialists.” Each
crop can be grown in an environment ideally suited
to its unique requirements.

  - As diversity increases, so do opportunities for coex
istence and beneficial interference between species
that can enhance agroecosystem sustainability. The
relationships between nitrogen-fixing legumes and
associated crop plants discussed earlier are a prime
example.

  - In a diverse agroecosystem, the disturbed environ
ments associated with agricultural situations can
be better taken advantage of. Open habitats can be
colonized by useful species that already occur in
the system, rather than by weedy, noxious pioneer
invaders from outside.

  - High diversity makes possible various kinds of ben
eficial population dynamics among herbivores and
their predators. For example, a diverse system may
encourage the presence of several populations of



herbivores, only some of which are pests, as well
as the presence of a predator species that preys on
all the herbivores. The predator enhances diversity
among the herbivore species by keeping in check
the populations of individual herbivore species.
With greater herbivore diversity, the pest herbivore
cannot become dominant and threaten any crop.

  - Greater diversity often allows better resource-use

efficiency in an agroecosystem. There is better
system-level adaptation to habitat heterogeneity,
leading to complementarity in crop species needs,
diversification of the niche, overlap of species
niches, and partitioning of resources. The traditional corn–bean–squash intercrop, for example,
brings together three different but complementary
crop types. When all three are planted in a heterogeneous field, soil conditions at any one site are likely
to adequately meet the needs of at least one of the
three crops. When planted in a uniform field, each
crop will occupy a slightly different niche and make
different demands on the soil’s nutrients.

  - Diversity reduces risk for a farmer, especially in

areas with more unpredictable environmental conditions. If one crop does not do well, income from
others can compensate.

  - When livestock animals are integrated into an agro
ecosystem, many opportunities arise for beneficial
interactions. Grazing, for example, can allow better
nutrient cycling, increase the numbers of the beneficial arthropods that occupy the microsites provided
by perennial pasture plants, and shift the dominance
of noncrop species. These and other interactions are
discussed in more detail in Chapter 19.

  - A diverse crop assemblage can create a diversity of

microclimates within the cropping system that can
be occupied by a range of noncrop organisms—
including beneficial predators, parasites, and
antagonists—that are of importance for the entire
system, and who would not be attracted to a very
uniform and simplified system.

  - Diversity in the agricultural landscape can con
tribute to the conservation of biodiversity in surrounding natural ecosystems, an issue that will be
discussed in Chapter 21.

  - Diversity—especially that of the belowground part

of the system—performs a variety of ecological services that have impacts both on and off the farm,
such as nutrient recycling, regulation of local hydrological processes, and detoxification of noxious
chemicals.


When our understanding of diversity extends beyond the
crop species to include noncrop plants (commonly called
weeds, but of potential ecological or human value), animals
(especially beneficial enemies of pests and animals useful
to humans), and microorganisms (belowground diversity
of bacteria, protists, and fungi is essential for maintaining


Agroecosystem Diversity **209**



many agroecosystem processes), we then begin to see the
range of ecological processes that are promoted by greater
diversity.


**Methods of Increasing Diversity in Agricultural Systems**
A range of options and alternatives are available for adding the benefits of diversity discussed earlier to the agricultural landscape. These alternatives can involve (1) adding
new species to existing cropping systems, (2) reorganizing or restructuring the species already present, (3) adding
diversity-enhancing practices or inputs, and (4) eliminating diversity-reducing or diversity-restricting inputs or
practices.


_Intercropping_

A primary and direct way of increasing the alpha diversity of
an agroecosystem is to grow two or more crops together in
mixtures that allow interaction between the individuals of the

different crops. Intercropping is a common form of multiple
cropping, which is defined as “the intensification and diversification of cropping in time and space dimensions” (Francis
1986). Intercropping can add temporal diversity through the
sequential planting of different crops during the same season, and the presence of more than one crop adds horizontal,
vertical, structural, and functional diversity. Best developed
in traditional farming systems in rural or developing areas,
especially in the tropics, intercropping or polyculture systems vary from relatively simple mixtures of two or three
crop plants to the very complex mixtures of crops found in
agroforestry or home garden agroecosystems (discussed in
more detail in Chapter 18) (Figure 17.4).


(a) (b)



_Strip Cropping_

Another form of multiple cropping is to plant different crops
in adjacent strips, creating what may be called a polyculture
of monocultures. This practice, which increases beta diversity instead of alpha diversity, can provide many of the diversity benefits of multiple cropping. For some crops and crop
mixtures, it is a more practical method of increasing diversity because it presents fewer management and harvest challenges than multiple cropping.


_Hedgerows and Buffer Vegetation_
Trees or shrubs planted around the perimeter of fields, or
blocks or strips of seminatural vegetation left in place, can
have many useful functions. In practical terms, they can
provide protection from wind, exclude (or enclose) animals,
and produce an array of tree products (firewood, construction materials, fruit, etc.). Ecologically, hedgerows and buffer strips increase the beta diversity of the farm, and can
serve to attract and provide habitat for beneficial organisms.
When planted as wider strips, especially between farmland
and adjacent natural ecosystems, they form buffer zones that
can mitigate a range of potential impacts of one system on
the other, as well as increase the overall biodiversity of the
region (Figure 17.5).


_Covercropping_
A covercrop is a noncrop species planted in a field to provide
soil cover, usually in-between cropping cycles. Covercrops
range from annuals to perennials, and include many different taxonomic groups, although grasses and legumes are
used predominantly. Increasing the diversity of a system

disease management. Research on the impacts of rotations on
the dimensions of diversity can improve the effectiveness of
this important practice.

by planting one or more covercrop species has a variety of
important benefits. Covercropping enhances soil organic
matter, stimulates soil biological activity and diversity of the
soil biota, traps nutrients in the soil left over from previous
crops, reduces soil erosion, contributes biologically fixed
nitrogen (if one of the covercrop species is a legume), and
provides alternate hosts for beneficial enemies of crop pests.
In some systems, such as orchards, covercrops may serve the
additional purpose of inhibiting weed development (Sullivan
2003).


_Rotations_

Growing crops in rotation is an important method of increasing the diversity of a system over the dimension of time.
Rotations usually involve planting different crops in succession or in a recurring sequence. The greater the differences
between the rotated crops in their ecological impacts on the
soil, the greater the benefits of the method. Alternating crops
can create what is known as a rotational effect, where a crop
grown after another does better than when grown in continuous monoculture. By adding residues of different species
of plants to the soil, rotations help maintain the biological
diversity of soil microorganisms. Each residue type varies
chemically and biologically, stimulating and/or inhibiting
different soil organisms. In some cases, the residue from
one crop is able to promote the activity of organisms that
are antagonistic to pests or diseases for a subsequent crop.
Rotations also tend to improve soil fertility and soil physical
properties, reduce soil erosion, and add more organic matter.
The well-known advantages of soybean/corn/legume–hay
rotations in the Midwestern United States are based in part
on the way that greater temporal diversity aids nutrient and



_Fallows_

A variation of the rotation practice is to allow a period in the
cropping sequence where the land is simply left uncultivated,
or fallow. The introduction of a fallow period allows the
soil to “rest,” a process that involves secondary succession
and the recovery of diversity in many parts of the system,
especially the soil. Shifting cultivation, discussed in Chapter
10, is probably the most well-known fallow system; the long
rest period allows the reintroduction of native plant and
animal diversity and the recovery of soil fertility. In some
systems, the fallow principle is used to create a mosaic of
plots in different stages of succession, from farmed fields to
second growth native vegetation. In dry-farmed regions, fallow may occur in alternate years to allow rainfall to recharge
soil moisture reserves, while at the same time promoting the
recovery of diversity in the soil ecosystem during the uncultivated cycle. Another variation on the use of the fallow is to
make it productive in addition to being protective: in swidden–fallow agroforestry, specific crop plants are introduced
just before the fallow begins, or intentionally allowed to reestablish, so that harvestable products can be obtained during
the fallow period (Denevan and Padoch 1987). Wherever a
fallow period is incorporated into the cropping cycle, it is the
lack of human-induced disturbance, not just the absence of a
crop, that allows the diversity recovery process.


_Reduced or Minimum Tillage_

Since disturbance in an agroecosystem has a major role in
limiting successional development and diversity, a practice
that minimizes disturbance may help enhance diversity.
Reducing the intensity of soil cultivation and leaving residues on the surface of the soil is a primary method of effecting reduced system disturbance. The many advantages to be
gained from reducing both the frequency and intensity of
tillage were discussed in Chapter 8. Compared to conventional tillage, no-till practices show increased earthworm
abundance and activity, diversification of soil biota, and an
accompanying improvement in soil structure, nutrient holding capacity, internal nutrient cycling, and organic matter
content (Coleman et al. 2009). Even when the aboveground
diversity of the cropping system remains low, the species
diversity of the decomposer subsystem of the soil increases
with reduced soil disturbance. Increasing plant diversity
aboveground as well can only enhance this subsystem.


_High–Organic Matter Inputs_

High levels of organic matter are crucial for stimulating species diversification of the belowground subsystem, involving the same type of stimulation of structural and functional
diversity noted earlier for reduced-tillage systems. Long seen
as a key component of organic agriculture, high–organic
matter inputs have an array of benefits that were reviewed
in Chapter 8. The organic matter content of the soil can be


Agroecosystem Diversity **211**



increased by applying composts, incorporating crop residues
into the soil, Covercropping, diversifying crops, and using
other diversity-enhancing cropping practices.


_Reduction in Use of Chemical Inputs_

It has long been known that many agricultural pesticides
either harm or kill many nontarget organisms in crop systems, or leave residues that can limit the abundance and
diversity of many other organisms. Thus, eliminating or
reducing the use of pesticides removes a major impediment
to the rediversification of the agroecosystem. The recolonization process involved in this rediversification is discussed
later in this chapter. It must be acknowledged, however, that
removing pesticides from a system that has become dependent on them is a challenging task. The first response may
be a dramatic increase in the pest population; only with time
and the reestablishment of diversity can internal mechanisms
develop for keeping the pest in check.


_Integration of Livestock_

Integrating animals back into the agricultural landscape
increases the overall biodiversity of the agroecosystem. In
addition, animal activity, such as grazing, crop residue consumption, and manure deposition can alter aspects of structural diversity, species dominance, and system function.
Additional benefits accrue in the diversification of the farm
enterprise itself. Livestock integration is discussed in more
detail in Chapter 19.


**Managing Diversification**
Moving from a uniform, monoculture agroecosystem to a
more diverse system supporting beneficial processes and



interactions is a multistep process. Initially, all of the aforementioned ways of introducing diversity into the agricultural
landscape help mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural
activities. Then the introduction of more species, either as a
direct or indirect effect, broadens the opportunities for integrated agroecosystem structure and function, allowing builtin buffers and system dynamics to dampen variability of
system response. Finally, the kinds and forms of interference
in the diversifying landscape make possible more types of
interactions, ranging from competitive exclusion to symbiotic
mutualisms (Table 17.3).

Managing diversity at the farm level is a big challenge.
Compared to conventional management, it can involve more
work, more risk, and more uncertainty. It also requires more
knowledge. Ultimately, however, understanding the ecological basis for how diversity operates in agroecosystems, and
taking advantage of complexity rather than striving to eliminate it, is the only strategy leading to sustainability.


**EVALUATING AGROECOSYSTEM**

**DIVERSITY AND ITS BENEFITS**


To manage diversity most effectively, we need means of measuring diversity and evaluating how increases in diversity
actually impact the performance and functioning of an agroecosystem. We need to be able to recognize the presence of
diversity and the patterns of its distribution on the landscape,
and we need to know if, and to what extent, the presence of
that diversity is of benefit to the performance of the agroecosystem, especially from the farmer’s point of view. Several
approaches can be taken to analyze and research the presence
and impacts of diversity.

**I** **ndices** **of** **S** **pecies** **D** **iversity**


It is obvious that any kind of intercrop is more diverse than
a monoculture. Comparing the diversity of two different
intercropping systems, however—varying in both species
numbers and planting ratios—requires that we measure the
diversity of each. To do so, we can borrow tools and concepts
developed by ecologists for natural ecosystems.

Ecologists recognize that the diversity of an ecosystem or
community is determined by more than just the number of
species. A community made up of 50 redwood trees, 50 tanbark oaks, and 50 Douglas firs is more diverse than one made
up of 130 redwood trees, 10 tanbark oaks, and 10 Douglas
firs. Both have the same number of species and total individuals, but the individuals in the first community are distributed more evenly among the species than those in the second
community, where redwood trees dominate.

This example demonstrates that there are two components
of species diversity: the number of species, called **species**
**richness**, and the evenness of the distribution of the individuals in the system among the different species, called
**species evenness** . Both components must be considered in
any comprehensive measurement of diversity, in both natural
ecosystems and agroecosystems.

How these concepts can be applied in analyzing the diversity of agroecosystems is demonstrated in Table 17.4, where
four different hypothetical systems, each with the same number of individual crop plants, are compared. Among these
systems, the even polyculture of three crops is the most
diverse, since it is the only one in which both species richness
and species evenness are high in relation to the other systems.

Instead of using the number of individuals of each species as a basis for measuring a system’s species diversity, it
is possible to use some other species characteristic, such as
biomass or productivity. This may be more appropriate, for
example, when the biomass of a typical individual of one species is very different from the biomasses of the individuals
of the other species. Number of individuals, biomass, and
productivity are all examples of **importance values** for a
particular species.

Ecology offers various ways of quantifying the species
diversity of a system. The simplest method is to ignore species evenness, and to measure the number of species in terms



of the number of individuals. Such a measure is provided by
Margalef’s index of diversity:


_s_ −1
Diversity =
log _N_


where


_s_ is the number species
_N_ is the number of individuals


The usefulness of Margalef’s index is limited because it
cannot distinguish the varying diversity of systems with the
same _s_ and _N_, such as the even and uneven three-crop polycultures in Table 17.4.


There are two other diversity indices that do take species evenness into account, and are therefore more useful.
The **Shannon index** is an application of information theory,
based on the idea that greater diversity corresponds to greater
uncertainty in picking at random an individual of a particular
species. It is given by the following formula:



_S_
⎛ _n_ _i_ ⎞⎛ _n_ _i_ ⎞
= − log _e_

_N_ _N_

[∑] _i_ =1 ⎝ [⎜] ⎠ [⎟] ⎝ [⎜] ⎠ [⎟]



_H_ = − _n_ _i_ log _e_ _n_ _i_
_N_ _N_

[∑] [⎜] [⎟][⎜]



_i_ _i_

log _e_



_i_



1



where _n_ _i_ is the number of individuals in the system (or
sample) belonging to the _i_ th species.

The **Simpson index** of diversity is the inverse of an
index of community dominance with the same name. It is
based on the principle that a system is most diverse when
none of its component species can be considered any more
dominant than any of the others. It is given by the following formula:



( −1)



_N N_



−
Diversity =



∑ _n n_ _i_ ( _i_ −1 )



_n n_ _i_ _i_



1



For the Simpson index, the minimum value is 1; for the
Shannon index it is 0. Both minimums indicate the absence

of diversity, the condition that exists in a monoculture. In
theory, the maximum value for each index is limited only by
the number of species and how evenly distributed they are

Simpson indices of 5 or greater, and Shannon indices of 3–4.

Calculations of Margalef, Simpson, and Shannon index
values for the hypothetical systems in Table 17.4 are given in
Table 17.5. The Shannon and Simpson values both show that
the even polyculture of two crops is more diverse than the
uneven polyculture of three crops, underscoring the importance of species evenness in agroecosystem diversity.

indices, including the theory on which they are based and the
ways they can be applied, can be found in the ecology texts
cited in Recommended Reading section.


**A** **ssessing** **the** **B** **enefits** **of** **I** **ntercrop** **D** **iversity**


On a farm, a way of measuring the value gained from greater
diversity in the cropping system will be very useful in helping
the farmer evaluate the advantages or disadvantages of different cropping arrangements. The diversity indices described
earlier can quantify diversity, but they don’t tell us how that
diversity translates into performance, or what the ecological
basis of any improved performance is. In cropping systems
where two or more crop species are in close enough proximity to each other, various kinds of between-species interference are possible (as described in Chapters 11 and 16) that
can provide clear benefits in improved yield, nutrient cycling,
and so on.


Despite the fact that researchers have accumulated a great
deal of evidence that intercropping can provide substantial yield advantages over monocropping, it is important to
remember that there can also be disadvantages to intercropping. There may be practical difficulties in the management
of the intercrop, and yield decreases may occur because of
the effects of adverse interference. Such cases should not

be used as arguments against intercropping, but rather as a
means of determining where research needs to be focused to
avoid such problems.


**Land Equivalent Ratio**
An important tool for the study and evaluation of intercropping systems is the land equivalent ratio (LER). LER provides an all-other-things-being-equal measure of the yield
advantage obtained by growing two or more crops as an
intercrop compared to growing the same crops as a collection
of separate monocultures. LER thus allows us to go beyond a
description of the pattern of diversity into an analysis of the
advantages of intercropping.



The LER is calculated using the following formula:



LER =
∑



_Yp_ _i_

_Ym_ _i_



where


_Yp_ is the yield of each crop in the intercrop or polyculture
_Ym_ is the yield of each crop in the sole crop or monoculture


For each crop ( _i_ ) a ratio is calculated to determine the partial
LER for that crop, and then the partial LERs are summed to
give the total LER for the intercrop. An example of how the
LER is calculated is given in Table 17.6.

An LER value of 1.0 is the break-even point, indicating no
difference in yield between the intercrop and the collection
of monocultures. Any value greater than 1 indicates a yield
advantage for the intercrop, a result called **overyielding** . The
extent of overyielding is given directly by the LER value: an
LER of 1.2, for example, indicates that the area planted to
monocultures would need to be 20% greater than the area
planted to the intercrop for the two to produce the same combined yields. An LER of 2.0 means that twice as much land
would be required for the monocultures.


**Application and Interpretation**
**of the Land Equivalent Ratio**
Since the partial and total LER values are ratios, and not
actual crop yields, they are useful for comparing diverse crop
mixtures. In a sense, the LER measures the level of intercrop
interference going on in the cropping system.

Theoretically, if the agroecological characteristics of
each crop in a mixture are exactly the same, planting them
together should lead to the same total yield as planting
them apart, with each crop member contributing an equal

proportion to that total yield. For example, if two similar
crops are planted together, the total LER should be 1.0 and
the partial LERs should be 0.5 for each. In many mixtures,
however, we obtain a total LER greater than 1.0, and partial
LERs proportionately greater than what would theoretically
be obtained if each crop were agroecologically the same as
the others. A total LER higher than 1.0 indicates the presence of positive interferences among the crop components of
the mixture, and may also mean that any negative interspecific interference that exists in the mixture is not as intensive
as the intraspecific interference that exists in the monocultures. Avoidance of competition or partitioning of resources
is probably occurring in the mixture.

When the total LER is greater than 1.5, or when the partial LER of at least one member of the mixture is greater
than 1.0, there is strong evidence that negative interference is
minimal in the intercrop interactions and that positive interferences allow at least one of the members of the crop mixture to do better in the intercrop than it does when planted in
monoculture.


The traditional corn–bean–squash intercrop discussed
in Chapter 16—with a total LER of 1.97—provides a good
example of this situation (see Table 16.3). The corn component
of the system expressed a partial LER of 1.50, meaning that
it actually produced better in the mixture than when planted
alone. The positive interference responsible for this result was
a combination of enhanced N availability from biological fixation by _Rhizobium_ bacteria in the roots of the beans, possible
transfer of some of this N through the mutualistic mycorrhizal
connections between the corn and beans, and habitat modification by the squash that enhanced the presence of beneficial
insects and reduced pests (described in the previous chapter).
Although partial LERs for beans and squash were very low
(0.15 and 0.32 respectively), their presence obviously was
important for the yield enhancement of the corn.

When the total LER is less than 1.0, negative interference
has probably occurred, especially if the LERs of the component parts of the mixture are all lowered in a similar fashion.
In this case the intercrop provides a yield disadvantage compared to monocropping.

When analyzing LERs and partial LERs, confusion can
often arise about what constitutes an advantage and what the
magnitude of the advantage is. Avoiding confusion requires
the recognition that different circumstances call for different
criteria for evaluating an intercrop’s advantage. There are at
least three basic situations (Willey 1981):


1. _When combined intercrop yield must exceed the_

_yield of the higher-yielding sole crops_ . This situation
may exist when assessing mixtures of very similar
crops, such as pasture forage mixes, or mixtures of
genotypes within a crop, such as a multiline wheat
crop. In such cases, partial LERs are not important
in determining advantage as long as total LER is
greater than 1.0, because the farmer’s requirement is
mostly for maximum yield, regardless of which part
of the crop system it comes from. The quantitative



advantage is the extent to which the combined intercrop yield is increased and total LER exceeds 1.0,
as compared to the yield of the highest yielding sole

crop.
2. _When intercropping must give full yield of a_ “ _main_ ”

_crop plus some additional yield of a second crop_ .
This situation occurs when the primary requirement
is for some essential food crop or some particularly
valuable cash crop. For there to be an advantage to
the intercrop, total LER must exceed 1.0 _and_ the
partial LER of the primary crop should be close
to 1.0 or even higher. With the emphasis on a key
crop, the associated plants must provide some positive intercrop interference. The corn–bean–squash
intercrop mentioned earlier is a good example of
this situation because the farmer is mainly interested in the corn yield. If some additional yield is
obtained from the beans and squash, even if their
partial LERs are very low, it is seen as an additional
bonus beyond the yield advantage gained by corn.
The quantitative advantage is the extent to which
the main crop is stimulated beyond its performance
in monoculture.

3. _When the combined intercrop yield must exceed_

_a combined sole-crop yield._ This situation occurs
when a farmer needs to grow both (or all) the component crops, especially when there is limited land
for planting. For the intercrop to be advantageous,
total LER must be greater than 1.0, but no member of the mixture can suffer a great reduction in
its partial LER in the process. Negative interference definitely cannot be functioning for such a
mixture to be beneficial. This situation can present problems in the use of the LER value since it
is not always readily apparent what proportions of
sole crops the total LER value should be based on.
Comparison cannot be made only on sown proportions because interference in the intercrop situation
can often produce yield values that are very different from the monocrop’s proportions, leading to
skewed partial LERs.


Recognizing these different situations is important for two
reasons. First, it helps to ensure that research on a given combination is likely to be grounded in farming practice. Second,
it should ensure that yield advantages are assessed in valid,
quantitative terms that are appropriate to the situation being
considered. Ultimately, the intercropping pattern that functions best is the one that meets the criteria of both the farmer

and the researcher.


To put certain different crops on a more comparable basis,
figures other than harvest yields can be used to calculate an
LER (Andersen et al. 2004). These measurements include
protein content, total biomass, energy content, digestible
nutrient content, or monetary value. Such calculations allow
the use of a similar indicator to evaluate different contribu
tions the crop may make to the agroecosystem. For example,


Agroecosystem Diversity **215**



in a legume/grass mix for animal forage production, it was
found that a 50:50 intercrop of the two gave a dry matter
forage LER that averaged 1.36 over 2 years and an LER
crude protein estimate of forage quality of 1.52 over the
same period. These results indicate that not only was there
more biomass produced in the mixture, but its quality was
increased as well (Seyedeh et al. 2010).


**COLONIZATION AND DIVERSITY**


Up to this point we have explored how the farmer can directly
increase diversity by planting more species, and how he or
she can create the conditions that allow “natural” diversification to occur in an agroecosystem. We have ignored the
question of how organisms not actually planted by the farmer
enter the system and establish themselves there. This question concerns both the desirable organisms whose presence is
encouraged—such as predators and parasites of herbivores,
beneficial soil organisms, and helpful allelopathic weeds—
and the undesirable ones, such as herbivores, that the farmer
would like to exclude from the system.

To address this question of how an agroecosystem is colonized by organisms, it is helpful to think of a crop field as an
“island” surrounded by an “ocean” that organisms have to
cross in order to become part of the species diversity of the
agroecosystem. In an ecological sense, any isolated ecosystem surrounded by distinctly different ecosystems is an island
because the surrounding ecosystems set limits on the ability
of organisms to reach and colonize the island. Building on our
study of the dispersal and establishment process in Chapter
14, we will here explore how the study of the colonization of
actual islands by organisms can be applied to understanding
the colonization of agroecosystems and how this process is
related to agroecosystem diversity.


**I** **sland** **B** **iogeography** **T** **heory**


The body of ecological theory concerning islands is known as
island biogeography (MacArthur and Wilson 1967). It begins
with the idea that island ecosystems are usually very isolated
from other similar ecosystems. The sequence of events that
allows an organism to reach an island sets in motion a set of
responses that guide the development of the island ecosystem.
A key characteristic of an island is that many of the interactions that eventually determine the actual niche of an organism
after it reaches the island are very different from the conditions
of the niche the organism left behind. This situation gives the
organism an opportunity to occupy more of its potential niche,
or even evolve characteristics that could allow it to expand
into a new niche. This is especially true in the case of a newly
formed island in the ocean—an environment very similar to
that of a recently disturbed (e.g., plowed) farm field. The first
pest to arrive in an “uncolonized” field has the opportunity to
very rapidly fill its potential niche, especially if it is a specialist pest adapted to the conditions of the crop in that field.

Island biogeography theory offers methods of predicting the outcome of the species diversification process on



an island. These methods take into account the size of the

island, the effectiveness of the barriers limiting dispersal to
the island, the variability of the habitats on the island, the
distance of the island from sources of emigration, and the
length of time the island has been isolated.

Experimental manipulation of island systems (Simberloff
and Wilson 1969) and studies of island diversity have provided the basis for the following principles:


  - The smaller the island, the longer it takes for organ
isms to find it.

  - The further an island is from the source of colonists,

the longer it takes for the colonists to find it.

  - Smaller and more distant islands have smaller and

more depauperate flora and fauna.

  - Many niches on islands can be unoccupied.

  - Many of the organisms that reach islands occupy a

much broader niche than the same or similar organisms on the mainland.

  - Early colonizers often arrive ahead of limiting pred
ators and parasites, and can experience very rapid
population growth at first.

  - As colonization proceeds, changes occur in the

niche structure of the island, and extinction of earlier colonists can take place.

  - The earliest arrivals are mostly _r_ -selected.


Ultimately, the theory should be able to predict the colonization and extinction rates that are possible for a particular
island. Such a prediction should then make it possible to
understand the relationship between ecological conditions
and potential species diversity, and what factors control the
establishment of an equilibrium between extinction and further colonization.

The parallels between islands and crop fields allow researchers to apply island biogeography theory to agriculture.
Experiments can be designed where either one crop field is
completely surrounded by a different crop, or small plots are
marked out in a larger field of the same crop. An early example was a study by Price (1976) of the rates that pests and
natural enemies colonize soybean fields. The study was carried out using small plots in a field of soybeans as the experimental islands; the plots were surrounded by an “ocean” of
soybeans, with natural forest abutting one side, and more
soybean fields on the other sides. Small plots in the soybean
field located at different distances from the various sources of
colonization were monitored for the full crop season, allowing the measurement of the arrival rates, abundance, and
diversity of both pests and their beneficial control agents. The
more easily dispersed pests were the first ones to reach the
interior plots of the field, and were followed later by some of
their predators and parasites. The equilibrium between species and individuals of both pests and natural enemies that
was predicted by island biography theory was not reached,

between the component parts of the agroecosystem, including both crop and noncrop elements. The challenge for the
agroecologist is to demonstrate the advantages that can be
gained from introducing diversity into farming systems,
incorporating many of the components of ecosystem function that are important in nature, and managing such diversity
for the long term.

pests to the crop.


probably due to the short life cycle of a soybean field. This
study has encouraged other studies of a similar nature (see
Altieri and Nicholls 2004b).

More recent research suggests that beneficial arthropods
move more readily into a crop field from their refuges surrounding the field when they are provided with habitat highways—vegetated corridors providing food and refuge—that
penetrate into the crop field (e.g., Nicholls et al. 2000). In
terms of island biogeography theory, this is the equivalent
of building land bridges from the continent to the island. A
study examining how this principle operates in a vineyard
is described in Using Flowering Plant Corridors to Increase
Beneficial Insect Diversity in a Vineyard case study.

Denys and Tscharntke (2002) conducted a study focusing
on insect species richness in different types of margin vegetation strips surrounding crop fields. Higher ratios of predatory
to herbivorous insects were observed in larger strips, thus supporting the trophic-level hypothesis of island biogeography,
which states that the role of predators and parasitoids tends to
increase with area. Pisani Gareau and Shennan (2010) examined hedgerows of native perennial species around diverse
vegetable crops on the central coast of California, and found
that there were high numbers of beneficial insects in these
border areas, and they moved as far as 100 m into the cropping system in search of prey, supporting the adaptation of
the island biogeography theory that predicts that sources of
colonization should play an important role in increasing biological pest management potential (Figure 17.6).


**DIVERSITY, RESILIENCE, AND SUSTAINABILITY**


Diversity in agroecosystems can take many forms, including
the specific arrangement of crops in a field, the way that different fields are arranged, and the ways that different fields
form part of the entire agricultural landscape of a farming
region. With increased diversity, we can take advantage of
the positive forms of interference that lead to interactions



In part, meeting this challenge means determining the
relationships between the different kinds of diversity presented in this chapter and a system’s resistance and resilience.
Since each species in the agroecosystem brings something
different to the processes that maintain resilience and resistance, an important part of agroecological research is focused
on understanding the contribution each species makes and
using this knowledge to integrate each species into the system in the optimal time and place. As this integration takes
place, the emergent qualities of the system appear, allowing
the ultimate emergent quality—sustainability—to develop.

The most sustainable agroecosystems might be those that
have some kind of mosaic pattern of structure and development, in which the system is a patchwork of levels of diversity, mixing annuals, perennials, shrubs, trees, and animals.
Or the most sustainable systems might be those with several stages of development occurring at the same time as
a result of the type of management applied. Such systems
might incorporate minimum tillage to allow a more mature
soil subsystem to develop, even with a simpler aboveground
plant system, or use strip cropping or hedgerows to create
a mosaic of levels of development and diversity across the
farm landscape. Once the parameters of diversity are established, the issue becomes one of the frequency and intensity
of disturbance—which we will explore in the next chapter.

the theory of island biogeography.

**CASE STUDY: USING FLOWERING PLANT CORRIDORS TO INCREASE**

**BENEFICIAL INSECT DIVERSITY IN A VINEYARD**

In many of the grape-growing regions of California, large-scale monoculture vineyards dominate the landscape. The
numbers of natural insect predators and parasitoids that might otherwise exist in these landscapes are greatly reduced
because of the relative lack of important food resources and overwintering sites offered by natural and noncrop vegetation.

In contrast, where viticulturalists have retained or created a more diverse landscape by keeping vineyards smaller and
maintaining natural vegetation patches and riparian corridors at vineyard perimeters, they have encouraged the presence
of natural predators and parasitoids. The positive effect of landscape diversification practices in increasing the diversity
of beneficial insects has been demonstrated in a variety of agroecosystems (Coombes and Sotherton 1986; Thomas
et al. 1991; Corbett and Plant 1993; Altieri 1994a).

In these more diverse viticultural areas, where strips and patches of natural and other noncrop vegetation are interspersed among monoculture vineyards, analysis of the dynamics of insect predator and herbivore populations is a good
application of island biogeography theory. The grape monocultures in these landscapes are “islands” in the sense that
beneficial insects don’t live in them year-round but instead disperse into them from the adjacent noncrop vegetation when
their prey and hosts are present.

A study by Nicholls et al. (2000) has shown that where noncrop vegetation already exists adjacent to a vineyard, its
positive effect on beneficial insect biodiversity can be greatly enhanced by a relatively simple practice: penetrate the vineyard with corridors of flowering plants contiguous with the adjacent natural vegetation. The corridors serve beneficials
both as a habitat and a “biological highway,” allowing them to move from their refugia in nonagricultural areas deep into
the vineyard (Figure 17.7).

The researchers compared two adjacent vineyard blocks that differed in only one respect: Block A was bisected by
a 600 m long corridor of noncrop vegetation contiguous with a bordering riparian forest; block B had the bordering
forest but no analogous corridor. The corridor in block A supported 65 species of locally adapted flowering plants,
including fennel ( _Foeniculum vulgare_ ), yarrow ( _Achillea millefolium_ ), daisy fleabane ( _Erigeron annuus_ ) and butterfly
bush ( _Buddleia_ spp.). Most of these plants were nonnative but not particularly weedy (an exception is fennel; care
should be taken in using it for such corridors).

Various sampling methods allowed the researchers to observe the following patterns:


   - The corridor supported a healthy diversity of arthropod predators including green lacewings, minute pirate

bugs, big-eyed bugs, damsel bugs, and several species of hoverflies, ladybugs, tumbling flower beetles, and
spiders.


**FIGURE 17.7** **Corridor of flowering plants penetrating the interior of a vineyard in California.** The corridor facilitates the
movement of beneficial insects into the vineyard from their refugia in the riparian forest (in the background).


**218** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems


   - Diversity of generalist predators overall was higher in the vineyard block with the plant corridor.

   - In the vineyard block with the corridor, the numbers of the two major grape herbivores present (western grape

leafhoppers and western flower thrips) were lowest near the plant corridor and highest in the central areas. In
the other vineyard block, these herbivores were distributed evenly throughout the block.

   - Most generalist predators showed a density gradient in the block with the corridor, reaching their greatest num
bers near the plant corridor. In the other block, these generalist predators were more evenly distributed.

   - The rate of parasitization of leafhopper eggs by _Anagrus epos_ wasps was roughly the same throughout both

vineyard blocks.


These results showed that the positive effect of the adjacent riparian forest on the biodiversity of beneficials was—with
the exception of _A. epos_ —amplified by the flowering plant corridor in block A. For ladybugs and lacewings, the corridor provided food in the form of aphids and other homoptera; for hoverflies it supplied nectar and pollen; for predatory
insects such as minute pirate bugs it offered neutral insect prey. By providing these food resources, the corridor allowed
beneficials to move more deeply into the vineyard. In island biogeography terms, the corridor effectively reduced the size
of the monoculture “islands,” facilitating their “colonization” by beneficials.

In addition to demonstrating the applications of island biogeography theory and the value of diversity, this study
highlights the importance of looking at diversity and ecological processes at the scale of the landscape. Agricultural
practices that allow, create, or retain a more diverse agricultural landscape that includes remnants of natural vegetation and noncrop areas are to be encouraged for a variety of reasons, a concept we will explore in more detail in
Chapter 23.

Using the concepts developed in the theory of island biogeography, it should be possible to manipulate “islandness”
in cropping systems in such ways as to either slow the arrival of pests or facilitate the movement of beneficials into the
system. Such an approach has potential for working with insects, weeds, and disease organisms. Ideally, we want to reach
a point where we can predict population structure and, as a result, use such information to determine the best size of
crop fields, their arrangement in the landscape, the distance between like crop fields, the amount of time the separation
is effective, and how this is all affected by the kind of crops or other vegetation in the areas between the target crops.
Again, we are dealing with a very complex set of factors, but the potential for using island theory in an agroecological
context is great (Table 17.7).
