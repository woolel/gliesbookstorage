## 19. Animals in Agroecosystems

Livestock animals figure prominently among the many reasons given in Chapter 1 for the unsustainability of industrial
agriculture. Confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs)
pollute the air and water, turning manure into a problem
instead of a resource; the meat industry stands as a prime
example of economic concentration, vertical integration, and
enemy of family farming; production of soybeans and corn
for animal feed takes up too high a percentage of the world’s
arable land; concentrated production of meat and animal
products for human consumption is energetically inefficient
and ecologically harmful; factory farming of meat tends to
undermine the economic base of rural farmers in developing countries who rely on small-scale livestock production;
diets trending toward more meat consumption accentuate
income disparities between rich and poor; and diseases of
livestock such a mad cow and avian flu threaten the human
population. Combined with the risks to human health presented by antibiotic- and hormone-laden meat and diets too
high in animal fat, these problems put livestock animals in
a bad light, making them a target for criticism among many
critics of industrial agriculture, advocates for sustainability,
and consumer activists, as well as vegetarians, animal rights
activists, and the like.

Certainly some of the criticism is well deserved. But
the problems lie not so much with the animals themselves
or their use as food as they do with the ways the animals
are incorporated into today’s agroecosystems and food
systems. Animals can play many beneficial roles in agroecosystems, and therefore make strong contributions to
sustainability. Indeed, as we will see in this chapter, the
inclusion of animals in an agroecosystem can often make
the difference in realizing ecological sustainability and
economic viability.

Relatively recently in agricultural history—around the
turn of the century in the United States—farms included
both livestock animals and crops as a matter of course. To
use the central concept in this chapter: crops and livestock
were integrated. The separation between crops and livestock
that has occurred since then represents a literal disintegration of agriculture. This disintegration not only threatens the
ecological foundations of our food system, it has also fundamentally altered the terms of the millennia-long mutualistic relationship we have developed with our domesticated
animals.


Sustainability today depends in part on reintegrating animals and crops (Figure 19.1). It demands not the rejection
of animal protein in our food system, but a more sensible
and integrated approach to raising livestock for food that



uses agroecological concepts and principles to adapt the best
aspects of pre–industrial agriculture into the post–industrial
age. In this chapter we will explore the ways this reintegration can take place. The focus is not on how to do animal husbandry sustainably, but rather on the synergisms that derive
from mixing crops and animals and their role in moving us
toward sustainability.


**ROLE OF ANIMALS IN ECOSYSTEMS**


Animals—defined broadly as heterotrophs—are essential components of all ecosystems on earth. They consume
autotrophs (plants), transforming their biomass into animal
biomass, which is eventually cycled back to autotrophs in
the form of nutrient-rich waste and once-living organic matter. Since agroecosystems are modified natural ecosystems,
managed for the purpose of harvesting biomass, they too
require animals. Of course, as the ultimate consumers of the
biomass harvested from agroecosystems, humans fill the animal role in all agroecosystems. But there are many reasons
why we shouldn’t be the only species in that role. As natural
ecosystems demonstrate, there is plenty of room in an agroecosystem for a variety of animal species.

As we explore the ways in which reintegrating nonhuman
animals into crop-based agroecosystems can help us achieve
more sustainable food production systems, we need to begin,
as always, with natural ecosystems. They show us how animals can enhance ecological integrity and stability, rather
than disrupting or degrading it.

The role that animals play in the structure and function of natural ecosystems was discussed in some detail in
Chapter 2. In Chapter 13, we discussed the many ways that
animals may act as factors of the environment confronting
crop plants (e.g., as pollinators and herbivores), and we covered the basic physiological processes and nutritional needs
of the animals commonly used for food and fiber production
in agroecosystems. Here, we review and expand on some of
the concepts presented in those chapters, with a view toward
applying that knowledge to the design and management of
agroecosystems that incorporate livestock animals.


**S** **haping** **V** **egetation**


As heterotrophic organisms in the trophic structure of an ecosystem, herbivorous animals consume the biomass produced
by plants, and this feeding behavior impacts the abundance,
distribution, and diversity of the plant species, which in a
terrestrial ecosystem are collectively termed the vegetation.

**FIGURE 19.2** **Bison grazing at Konza Prairie Biological**

houses are relocated daily so chickens can feed, help in weed management, and add manure to the soil. The walnut trees provide
shade in the hot summer. The chickens are marketed directly to direct influence of herbivores on ecosystem structure. The
consumers, who come to the ranch to pick up their freshly slaugh
proportion of shortgrass, midgrass, and tallgrass species

tered orders. Walnuts are harvested in the fall. A covercrop is

was determined primarily by grazing behavior and fire, with

grown during the winter.



Herbivorous animals are therefore key components—and
determinants—of the structural makeup of most terrestrial

ecosystems.

Because of the tight association between herbivores and
the plants they consume, many ecosystems show a strong
correlation between herbivore diversity and floral diversity.
For example, multispecies grazing by a diverse ungulate
fauna in the Serengeti of east Africa is intimately connected
to a striking richness in both predatory animals and plants
(McNaughton 1985, 1990; Murray and Illius 1996). Ten or
more species of grazing ungulate may be found in close
proximity, with several species occurring together in mixed
groups. These herbivores eat different plant species, different
parts of plants (leaves, stems, flowers), and plants in different life stages (green or dry); in addition, because of migration cycles, they put their herbivorous pressure on plants at
different times of the year. These variations in the dietary
specialization of each herbivore species coevolved with the
vegetation, the components of which followed diverse strategies for coping with herbivory and for using it to minimize
interspecific competition with other plants. The resulting
structural diversity of the system allowed niche overlap,
coexistence, and mutualisms to evolve as well and contribute
to further diversity.

The perennial grass prairie ecosystem of the North
American Great Plains—in its aboriginal form—was another
example of herbivore diversity coupled with floral diversity
(Figure 19.2). Bison, elk, antelope, and other grazers selectively consumed different plant species and, different plant
parts, at different times in the season, coevolving with a prairie vegetation comprised of shortgrass, midgrass, and tallgrass species. The prairie ecosystem also demonstrated the



direct influence of herbivores on ecosystem structure. The
proportion of shortgrass, midgrass, and tallgrass species
was determined primarily by grazing behavior and fire, with
shifts in one direction or the other due to abiotic factors such

as soil type and rainfall (Briske 1996). Following the severe
reduction in wild herds of the prairie herbivores, species
composition of the native plants changed as well.

Recent restoration programs for native prairie ecosystems
face the challenge of how to restore this native grazing pressure, or face the alternative of having to simulate the natural
grazing with fire, mowing, or the use of domestic animals.
At the Tallgrass Prairie Reserve in Oklahoma, The Nature
Conservancy is using herds of 2500 plus bison and a “patchburn” management tool of prescribed burning to restore the
prairie ecosystem and promote its original native plant and
animal diversity. In another case, the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF) has a goal of restoring 17–27 million acres of the
Northern Great Plains ecoregion, a scale of restoration large
enough to allow the ecoregion to support bison herds of at
least 10,000 animals each, as well as much of the accompanying plant and animal biodiversity characteristic of these
systems. In 2006, the WWF released the first 200 bison on
its American Prairie Reserve, and in 2010, prairie dogs were
moved from surrounding ranches and released into the center
of the reserve, where their burrows can also serve as homes
for the endangered black-footed ferret. The reserves are made
up of a unique mosaic of public, private, and tribal lands that
together provide the size necessary for these animal communities to thrive.


**E** **nabling** **E** **nergy** **F** **low**


When herbivores eat plants, and are in turn eaten by carnivorous animals, energy is flowing from one trophic level
to another. You will recall that the energy flow between trophic levels is inefficient. A relatively small percentage of
the solar energy fixed by photosynthesis and stored in plant


Animals in Agroecosystems **239**


biomass is preserved when that biomass is converted into
animal biomass at the next trophic level. The vast majority
of the energy (up to 90%) moving from one trophic level
to another is given off as metabolic heat by the animals or
deposited as manures back into the soil (Odum and Barrett
2005). The energy contained in the manures of animals is
not lost, however, because it is an essential driver of soil
organism activity.



The loss of energy at each jump in trophic level means
that the biomass at each higher level must be progressively
smaller—thus the shape of the familiar “energy pyramid” in
basic ecology texts. Since plants can occupy only the bottom level in the energy pyramid, the energy stored in animal
biomass at any level is essential to the secondary consumers at each higher trophic level. Thus animal diversity in an
ecosystem is a primary determinant of the number of trophic
levels through which energy can be transferred—that is, the
height of the energy pyramid and the diversity of the fauna
generally. Returning to the example of the Serengeti the
diversity of herbivores is what makes possible the relatively
high diversity of predators and other secondary consumers,
including cheetah, lions, hyenas, aardwolves, leopards, wild
dogs, jackals, eagles, vultures, crocodiles, and a variety of
smaller carnivores and omnivores.


**C** **ycling** **N** **utrients**


In all natural ecosystems, herbivorous animals play an essential role in the dynamic process by which matter is cycled
through the system. The emergent properties of efficiency,
productivity, and stability are all related to this fundamental

ecosystem process.

Ecosystems are dependent on animals, decomposers,
and detritivores to release nutrients from their storage in
plant material. Animals are therefore an important part of
the nitrogen cycle, the carbon cycle, and the phosphorous
cycle (all discussed in Chapter 2). Whether the nutrients are
released back into geologic or atmospheric reservoirs, the
initial step is consumption of plant tissue, followed by digestion, excretion, and decomposition (Figure 19.3).


**I** **nfluencing** **C** **ommunity** **D** **ynamics**


As discussed earlier, herbivory has a direct effect on the vegetation of an ecosystem. This was noted in a structural sense,
but it can also be understood in a functional sense, as a factor
affecting interspecific interactions and ecosystem complexity.
Grazing or foraging by herbivores involves selective removal
of certain species or plant parts, which affects how populations of each species in the community interact. Grazing pressure, for example, is often a key factor preventing a particular
plant species from dominating an ecosystem through competitive exclusion and thereby reducing diversity and complexity (Figure 19.4). When grazing patterns change—due, for
example, to removal of native grazers, changes in herbivore
populations, or introduction of nonnative herbivores—shifts
in plant species dominance inevitably occur.



**FIGURE 19.3** **Bison and bison manure.** The consumption of
plant biomass by animals contributes to the recycling of nutrients in
most natural ecosystems in the world. (Photo courtesy of Catherine

**FIGURE 19.4** **Cows improving woodland understory in south-**
**ern Spain.** Animals are moved through the system at key times to
manage herbaceous cover, promote tree development, and produce
animal products.


An example of the important role herbivores play in community dynamics is provided by ecosystems dominated by
introduced species. In many parts of the world, invasive
nonnative plant species have established dominance in association with introduced nonnative grazing animals, causing
changes in the native ecosystems that can persist even after
the exotic herbivores are removed (Colvin and Gliessman
2000). Conversely, invasion by nonnative plants can become
problematic because of the absence of herbivores able to control the aliens through consumption.

An awareness of how animals, especially larger herbivores, function as part of community dynamics and the
other ecosystem processes discussed earlier can guide us
as we consider how livestock may be integrated into crop
production. As heterotrophic consumers of plants (and
in some cases arthropod and molluscan pests), livestock


**240** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



animals can play a role in managing species interactions
(Chapter 16), increasing agroecosystem diversity and
resilience (Chapter 17), taking advantage of successional
processes (Chapter 18), and maximizing the efficiency of
energy capture and use (Chapter 20).


**COEVOLUTION OF LIVESTOCK**

**ANIMALS AND AGRICULTURE**


In the earliest human cultures, people made a living off the
land as hunters and gatherers, exploiting both the animals
and the plants available in the ecosystems around them.
Therefore, it is not surprising that as some human societies
developed economies that could support larger populations
and ensure more reliable food supplies, they domesticated
animals at about the same time as they domesticated plants.

Domestication was a coevolutionary process in two
senses. First, as discussed in Chapter 15, domesticated species changed in concert with human cultures, each becoming dependent on the other. Second, the domestication of
plants—that is, the development of agriculture—proceeded
in parallel with, and often directly connected with, the
domestication of animals and the development of grazing
and pasture systems.

The vastly different environments and ecosystems around
the world offered very different opportunities for, and placed
different constraints upon, the development of more settled
socioeconomic modes based on domestication of wild species. Some environments were too cold and arid to support
any kind of agriculture, but offered native ungulates suitable
for domestication. Other environments were conducive to

both agriculture and the raising of livestock. Of the prehistoric human cultures inclined to develop toward agricultural
societies, some created animal-based systems and others cropbased systems. In some cases the two were directly coupled.

However, while there are many examples of systems relying almost exclusively on domesticated animals, there are
very few crop-based systems that lack domesticated animals entirely. In this sense, animals are truly a hallmark of
agriculture.

Wherever animals were domesticated, they became an
integral part of human societies, receiving both care and
respect. In this way the mutualistic sense of “co-evolution”
was carried through. The raising of livestock is often called
**animal husbandry**, and in the older meaning of the term
_husbandry_, the concept of caretaking is clear. Husbandry
is defined in Webster’s 1913 dictionary as “care of domestic affairs; economy; domestic management; thrift.” Thus,
“animal husbandry” links the stewardship of domestic animals with the welfare of humans and their households.


**G** **razing** **and** **P** **asture** **S** **ystems**


First we’ll examine the development of systems based on
the domestication of grazing herbivores. This strand of
agricultural evolution resulted in animal-only systems that
survive to this day, but it also played a direct role in the



evolution of integrated systems employing both plants and
animals.


As explained in Chapter 15, humans transitioned from
observant hunter–gatherers, to careful managers of wild populations, to caretakers of livestock domesticates. During this
process, animals became dependent on humans for protection, feed, and reproduction, and humans came to depend on
animals for a range of services and products.

Depending on local environmental constraints and the
availability of native mammals and birds suitable for domestication, various types of food production systems incorporating animals were developed by human societies. These
systems evolved over time in different ways, but overall it is
possible to describe a general process of coevolution in which
the animals became more thoroughly domesticated, humans
intensified their management practices, and the plant species
eaten by the animals developed more desirable characteristics in response to management.

The earliest form of animal husbandry was pastoral
nomadism, in which humans accompanied animals as they
made their way across the landscape in search of feed and
water (Koocheki and Gliessman 2005). This mode of life
commonly developed in areas with relatively extreme, semiarid environments, where the animals that existed in the
wild state, such as the wild relatives of sheep and goats, were
preadapted to subsisting on sparse vegetative cover. Pastoral
nomadism still exists in some very arid and mountainous
lands, where it is doubtful that human communities would

be able to survive without their herds of domestic animals. In
regions where crop agriculture would be extremely difficult
or even impossible, at least without considerable technological intervention, these animals are able to forage for scarce
resources and turn vegetation that humans cannot consume
directly into harvestable animal products. As the caretakers
of these systems, humans must respect the limits of the carrying capacity of the landscape for grazing, understand the
seasonal and regional variations in resource availability, and
develop social structures around the needs of their animals.
There are examples of well-managed present-day nomadic
systems that date back to the early times of animal domestication, with some of the most notable in the arid regions of
the Middle East (Figure 19.5).

In parts of the world with more rainfall and more access
to water resources, pastoral nomadism evolved into a type of
managed grazing. People established permanent settlements,
and animals were taken out for periods of time to forage on
well-defined grazing areas. Good husbandry evolved into not
just caretaking the animals, but also maintaining the health
of the range lands. As discussed in Chapter 10, fire was most
likely one of the earliest tools used for pasture and range
improvement in these systems. They proved to be sustainable
when the human managers, using natural ecosystems as the
benchmark, developed and maintained a thorough knowledge of vegetative structure, species composition, forage
quality, and other indicators of healthy range or forage lands.

Managed grazing systems exist today in most parts of
the world, in arid to humid rainfall regimes, from warm to

While the coevolution of animals and forage plants was taking place, humans in some parts of the world were also developing crops for their own consumption. Animals were nearly
always part of this crop development, since they provided the
cultivation and transport power, as well as manures for fertilization of crops, and played a part in the diversification of
farm landscapes that must have come about as humans balanced the needs of themselves, their animals, and the environment upon which both depended.

cold climates, and across most soil types and conditions, in
ecosystems that include natural grasslands, shrublands with
forage and grasses, savannahs or open woodlands with trees
interspersed in grassland, or forests with understory vegetation appropriate for animal consumption (Hodgson and Illius
1996). When they are well managed and the type and number
of animals is appropriate to the vegetation, managed grazing
systems are sustainable alternatives to the CAFOs used to
produce much of the animal-derived food in the industrial
food system.

Ultimately, the coevolution of the human–livestock relationship reached another stage, in which humans planted
and managed pasture species for improved feed quality and
quantity. The transition from managing natural grazing ecosystems to the direct sowing of edible forage and pasture species probably occurred hand in hand with the domestication
of livestock that were capable of pulling cultivation implements and producing manures that could be applied as soil
improving amendments. Obviously a parallel coevolution
was taking place as well on the plant side of the equation,
as grain size, forage quality, and growth vigor all increased.
Grasses, grains, and legumes all became part of the pasture
mix, each providing complementary nutrition for livestock,
and balanced nutrient inputs to the soil. In places where there
was an extended time of the year when the planted pasture
would not grow, such as during a rainless summer or cold
winter, systems developed whereby the pasture biomass was
harvested, dried, and stored for feed to be used during the
time of scarcity, at which time the animals were often kept
in confinement.

Such pasture systems are still very common today all
over the world and, like managed grazing systems, they
can be highly sustainable means of producing animal-based
food and fiber products. Many agricultural universities and
colleges have entire departments and programs devoted
to the study of pasture design, management, and improvement, especially where animal production systems are most
prevalent.



Early agricultural societies all employed domesticated
animals to some extent. Ancient cultures in the Indus Valley
domesticated the chicken. The cultures of Southeast Asia

raised fowl and water buffalo. In Mesopotamia, cattle, sheep,
and goats were important (Figure 19.6). Even in the New
World, where domesticable wild species were less abundant, domesticated animals such as the turkey and hairless
dog played important roles in agricultural societies. The
Ancestral Puebloans of the American Southwest, for example, grew corn, beans, and squash, but raised domesticated
turkeys for feathers, emergency food, and fertilizer.

The degree of integration of plants and animals varied in
early agricultural systems. In some societies crop production
systems developed alongside livestock pasture systems; in
other cases, food derived from animal domesticates supplemented a crop-based system. Either way, the pattern was set
for integrated crop–livestock systems to develop along with
the major centers of human civilization.

These integrated systems involved a diverse mixture of
different activities, managed together as a working whole to


**FIGURE 19.6** **Domesticated sheep in ancient Mesopotamia.**
Domesticated animals, such as the sheep depicted on this fragment
of a stone carving in The Louvre, were important in the early form
of agriculture practiced in the “fertile crescent.”


**242** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



take advantage of the ecological complementarity of each
component, or enterprise. In many temperate parts of the
world with adequate rainfall, including the Middle East,
Europe, northern Africa, and southern Asia, integrated systems reached a level of considerable complexity. In early
modern Europe, for example, a typical integrated farm had
pasture for harvestable feed or forage (annual and perennial),
crops (annuals and perennials), animal grazing areas (with
some possible improvement in plant species used as forage),
corrals, forest or woodlot, often some sort of wetland, stream
or well, and places for human habitation and activity, along
with rotations and fallows involving multiple combinations
of each component.

This style of integrated farm—and the associated cultural
values of animal husbandry—was imported to the United
States, where it became the model system. Until the beginning of the twentieth century, most farms in the United States
showed this integration of multiple enterprises. Integrated
farms still exist today, but they are greatly outnumbered by
specialized and industrial-scale operations that completely
separate livestock and crop production.

The disintegration of livestock and crops came about
with the widespread introduction of specialized machinery,
fertilizers, and pesticides following World War II, but specialization in US agriculture began many decades before
that (Gregson 1996). In order to respond to uniform market
signals and distant markets, farmers began to rely on production inputs that had the effect of standardizing both growing conditions and response to management and climate.
Diversity seemed to be less necessary, and farms began to
simplify. Ready access to effective and cheap chemical fertilizers encouraged the perception that farmers no longer had
to depend on biological nitrogen fixation and nutrient recycling through livestock to maintain soil health. Government
support programs and academic research institutions further
promoted the value of specialization, and by the end of the
1980s, the separation of livestock and crops was fairly complete (Gregson 1996).

Yet, as we saw in Chapter 1, the problems associated with
the disassociation of livestock and crops—and the concomitant growth of large-scale confinement systems for livestock
and monoculture for crops—have come back to haunt us
(Nierenberg 2005). Now that sustainability is a primary goal
of agriculture, and the costs of the inputs that promoted specialization in the first place are rising faster than the value
of the crops they produce, the idea of integrating crops and
livestock has gained prominence once again.

Grazing and pasture-based animal production systems
have also gained attention for their potential to contribute to
a sustainable food system. Although all the food (and other
products, such as wool) produced in such systems comes from
a trophic level higher than that of primary producers, it can
be produced virtually without external inputs. Because they
have digestive systems adapted to break down cellulose and
other complex plant biomass that is indigestible by humans
(see Chapter 13), the grazing and browsing animals used in
these systems become a means for humans to access food



calories that ultimately come from inedible plants. Moreover,
well-managed grazing of rangelands in many parts of the
world (such as in the semiarid southwestern United States)
can help conserve biodiversity by replicating the ecological
functions once performed by wild, native ungulates.


**INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS**


An **integrated farm** is one in which livestock are incorporated into farm operations “specifically to capture positive
synergies among enterprises—to perform tasks and supply
services to other enterprises—not just as a marketable commodity” (Clark 2004). In this definition, “enterprise” refers
to any focus or purpose of the farm system, from saleable
products to weed management to soil health.

The positive synergies that arise from integrating animals
into agroecosystems come about in large part because of the
ecological complementarity of livestock animals and crop
and forage plants. Plants feed animals, and animal excrement provides, in concentrated form, the nutrients plants
require. Thus, an integrated system—as opposed to one
that is merely diversified—harnesses this complementarity
to move energy and nutrients between the crop component
and the animal component. When animals are integrated into
agroecosystems in this way, more of the ecosystem processes
operating in natural systems can be incorporated into the
functioning of the agroecosystem, increasing its resilience
and sustainability.


**E** **xamples** **of** **I** **ntegrated** **S** **ystems**


The basic concept of integrating the raising of animals and
the growing of crops in the same agroecosystem finds a variety of expressions around the world. The livestock component can include cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits, horses,
oxen, yaks, water buffalo, poultry, waterfowl, fish, shellfish,
bees, silkworms, or a variety of other species that can provide
food, fiber, work, manure, ecosystem services, or some combination of these. The crop component can include grains,
pulses, oilseeds, grazed forages, vegetables, potatoes, fruit
or nut trees, fruit vines, and other food crops. Given these
options, the possibilities for integration are nearly endless.
Four of the most important types of systems are described in
the following.


**Crop Rotations with a Grazed Forage Phase**
The most widespread and widely adaptable method of integrating livestock animals into cropping systems is the grazed
forage rotation. The specifics of the practice vary greatly,
but its essence is to rotate a field between crops grown for
human consumption (often grains) and a forage crop grazed
by livestock. A variation on this theme is to grow the forage
crop without grazing and then harvest it as feed for confined
livestock animals. The grazed forage rotation was once very
common all over the world, with the type of livestock, forage
species, crop species, and timing of the rotation all adapted
to local conditions.


Animals in Agroecosystems **243**


As has been discussed elsewhere in this text, crop rotations
in general have many benefits for overall agroecosystem sustainability. Weed growth (Chapter 14), agroecosystem diversity (Chapter 17), and water availability (Chapter 9) are just a
few factors that are positively affected. When an animal component is included, both the options for rotational sequences
and the potential benefits of the rotation are increased.



**Agropastoral Systems**
In some mountainous areas of the world, particularly in
Pakistan, India, China, Nepal, and Bhutan, the most common traditional agricultural system is agropastoral in nature.
Crop production in warmer valleys is combined with the
grazing of livestock animals on highland pastures during the
summer. Usually the livestock provide the major source of
income and food. Despite the spatial segregation in summer,
integration occurs in the use of animal manure for fertilizer
and the growing of forage crops for winter animal feed.


**Livestock in Agroforestry Systems**
An agroforestry system, as discussed in Chapter 18, is a system that integrates trees with crops, animals, or both. When
the focus is on the tree–animal combination it is referred to

as a **silvopastoral** system, and when all three (crops, animals, and trees) are integrated, the term **agrosilvopastoral**
system is used (Figure 19.7).

The practice of silvopastoral agroforestry is best known
in the tropics, where trees can mitigate the impacts of heavy
rainfall, nutrient leaching, and intense solar gain. Some the
most common silvopastoral agroecosystems involve the use

of trees as an overstory above either natural or improved
pasture (Buck et al. 1999). Typically, forest is cleared and
specific trees are left to form the shade over the pasture, and
often some additional tree species of ecological or economic
value are planted as well, in patterns that ensure good tree
development. The management of the animals in livestock
agroforestry systems is key, because it must meet the needs
of the trees—and the crops, if they are present—and the animals at the same time.

In mountainous regions of southern Europe, especially in the region of Andalusia, Spain, there exists a traditional agrosilvopastoral system that integrates livestock, crops, native herbaceous vegetation, and oak forest. Known in Spain as _dehesa_,
this integrated system shows the level of complexity and stability that can be achieved by combining careful management
of domestic grazing animals and limited crop agriculture in the context of the natural landscape (Sevilla-Guzmán 1999).

The term _dehesa_ was originally used to refer to parcels of land that were located at the margin of a community’s common grazing areas, meant to be used by specific community members for the pasturing and resting of the animals used
for meeting the farm labor needs of the community. Today, the term describes the management system practiced on the
forested lands surrounding communities, which were _dehesa_ in the older sense. These areas are vegetated by an open oak
forest of several _Quercus_ species, with an herbaceous understory that germinates with the first rains of the Mediterranean
fall, grows through the winter into spring, and is dry during the rainless summer.

The basis of the _dehesa_ system is rotational and mixed grazing by the traditional race of Iberian pig (Figure 19.8),
sheep, and occasional horses in the open oak forest. In addition, the people of the community gather firewood and some
cork from the forest, as well as a vast number of native plant species for use as food, medicine, and spices. In open areas
with better soils they grow small plots of forage grasses or legumes. More recently, cattle have been added to the mix of
grazers (see Figure 19.4), and native wildlife species are hunted for sport.

The key aspect of the _dehesa_ is the maintenance of the oak forest ecosystem. This is only possible with the rational
and careful integration of the animal component. Sheep, cattle, and horses graze the natural herbaceous cover during the
winter and spring, after which time they are either sold, moved to lowland areas with better pasture, or kept in limited
numbers on stored forage. The Iberian pig brood stock and the current year’s offspring are kept in large pens under oaks
where they are able to move freely, and are fed grain from the small production areas. In the late summer when the acorns
begin to fall from the trees, the young pigs are released from the pens and allowed to range freely and feed on the acorns.
In a period of less than 3 months, the pigs gain more than 50% of their weight on the acorn diet, producing flesh used for
the unique and highly sought-after ham they are famous for ( _jamón ibérico_ ). Cattle prefer the green herbaceous growth

of the winter months, and the sheep are able to do well on the green biomass of winter as well as dry plant material that
persists into the summer.

The _dehesa_ represents an example of the sustainable use of resources in a marginal environment. It is sustainable only
because its management is based on optimizing the natural productivity of the landscape through careful management of
livestock, not on maximizing yields. Its base is diversification, complementarity of plants and animals, extensive rather
than intensive use of the fragile natural resources of the oak forest, local animal breeds, and management knowledge
built up over centuries.

Competition from factory-farmed pork, the desire for higher returns per unit area of land, and the movement of rural
people to the cities, however, all put pressure on the this remarkable system. An agroecological understanding of its value
is needed to preserve it into the future.



Both trees (see Chapter 18) and livestock animals can
have many positive impacts on an agroecosystem, so when
the two are combined many components of sustainability
can be brought together. The journal _Agroforestry Systems_
contains many examples of research on animal-oriented
agroforestry systems that demonstrate many characteristics
of ecological sustainability and provide many economic and
social benefits as well.


**Aquaculture and Crop Production**
A variety of systems in use around the world incorporate the
raising of either waterfowl or aquatic species such as fish or
shellfish with crop production. As one might expect, these
systems are most common in areas with abundant moisture, where wetlands would predominate in the absence of
agriculture.

Integrated rice and duck farming is practiced in parts of
Japan and China (Furuno 2001). Weeds and insects are consumed by the ducks, manure from the ducks is returned to



fertilize the rice, and humans harvest both ducks and rice at
the end of the crop cycle (Figure 19.9). The movement of the
ducks agitates the water and induces stronger rice stems and
more resistance to lodging from wind and rain (Zhang et al.
2013). When the aquatic fern _Azolla_, with its nitrogen-fixing
algal mutualist, is added to the system, fertility is maintained
and yields improved. Similar results are achieved with the
integrated fish and rice systems of southern China (Guo and
Bradshaw 1991; Xie et al. 2011). By allowing fish to occupy
the irrigation channels and flooded rice paddies during the
cropping season, nutrients are captured that might otherwise
be lost from the system, especially in systems where the fish
are algae feeders and the algae thrive on nutrients in the
water. Even when part of the rice paddy is removed from rice
production in order to dig ponds that allow for year-round
presence of the fish, the ecological and economic benefits
more than compensate.

Fish can be such an agroecologically and economically
beneficial part of an integrated cropping system that some

systems have developed that combine fish, crops, and livestock.
In parts of Asia, for example, systems exist that integrate fish,
silkworms, mulberries, pigs, sugarcane, vegetables, and grass
in intensively managed wetlands. In some localities, farmers
are adding an aquaculture component to an already-integrated
crop–livestock system. Livestock manure is used to stimulate
the growth of algae or plankton, which are consumed by the
fish. Waste from the fish can then serve as a nutrient source for
the crops, and the fish themselves are a marketable product.

Integrated crop–aquaculture systems offer a clear contrast
to intensive, industrial-scale, single-species aquaculture systems (see the Special Topic on Aquaculture). In many respects,
these systems are not much different from the livestock confinement systems used for cattle, pigs, and poultry. Feed—­
different from what the animals consume in the wild—is

often grown a large distance from the place of animal production, antibiotics and growth stimulants are often employed,
and waste food and excrement contaminate the water.

As they pursue their ecological role, mimicking the herbivores in natural systems, livestock animals transform the
energy and matter contained in plant biomass into three
agroecologically useful streams, as shown in Figure 19.10.
The first stream, animal biomass, has value as food, fiber,
fertilizer, and raw material. The second stream is the biological cultural energy represented by the ability of livestock to do work. Draft animals, which once performed all
the work on farms that human’s didn’t do, are the obvious
workers among the many types of livestock, but sheep, goats,
chickens, ducks, and other animals can also perform valuable
“work” in the form of vegetation and weed management and
pest control. The third stream, manure, is rich in plant nutrients and provides soil microorganisms with a key source of
energy for their roles in the system.

itself combine to provide the farmer with an array of potential
on-farm benefits. These benefits are discussed separately as
follows, in the context of actual farm practices. The benefits are interrelated and overlapping, but by pulling them
apart conceptually it is easier to see how various forms of
integration can be combined to further the overall goal of
establishing mutualistic synergies that improve agroecosystem structure and function and lessen the dependence on
purchased external inputs. Table 19.1 summarizes many of
the benefits of integration by comparing the conditions of
an integrated system to those of a comparable nonintegrated
crop-based system.


**Producing Protein-Rich Food and Other Products**
Animal biomass is important as food, both for subsistence
and for market. Whether in the form of milk, meat, or eggs,
it contains a much higher proportion of protein than plant
biomass. Moreover, most livestock animals are able to obtain
nutrition from types of plant biomass that humans can’t eat—
crop waste, food waste, and plant tissues containing mostly
cellulose—and convert it into various forms of animal bio
mass that humans can eat.


Animal biomass has many other economically valuable
uses, of course. Sheep produce wool and waterfowl feathers;
and at the end of their lives animals yield bones and other byproducts that can be used for a variety of purposes.


**Putting Crop Residue and By-Products to Use**

Since animals are able to consume much of the biomass left

over after harvest, as well as many of the by-products from
agricultural processing, using such biomass as animal feed
is an important way to produce harvestable animal products and convert a potential waste into recyclable nutrients
at the same time. Maize, millet, wheat, oat, and barley straw
serve as supplemental feed for a range of animals in many

agroecosystems around the world, with the greatest energy
efficiency achieved when the site of straw production is as
close as possible to the consuming animals. Allowing the
animals to directly graze the straw remaining in the field is
probably the most efficient method, although straw can be
cut and hauled to a storage area in order to feed the animals
when they are confined.

In California, where intensive vegetable production is
so common, many crops produce residues that are used to
supplement animal grazing or forage, such as culled Brussels
sprouts, waste tomatoes, and carrot pulp after juice extraction. Pigs are excellent transformers of food and crop waste
in many rural small-farm systems in the developing world.
Since the animals in this case are not actually in the fields
where the vegetable crops are raised, the manure the animals
produce must be returned to the crop fields.


**Returning Nutrients to the Soil in Manure and Compost**
Plants contain nutrients they have taken up from the soil,
and through their consumption in plant biomass, digestion,
and deposition as manure, the nutrients are cycled back to
the soil. Depending on the farming system, the manure can
be collected, composted, and applied at any location on the
farm where it is needed most. Returning manure to the soil
is an important way to put both nutrients and organic matter
back into the soil ecosystem (see Chapter 8), as well as to
reduce the need to import these materials from outside the
farm operation.

The ecological and economic challenges of trying
to import to cropping systems the massive amounts of
manure and urine produced in large-scale livestock confinement systems have already been discussed in Chapter
1. Integrated livestock–cropping systems—in which forage is grown on the farm, fields are rotated between grazed
forage and crops, and crop residues are incorporated into
animal feed—can greatly increase the efficiency of manure
and compost management. A study carried out in Denmark



(Dalgaard et al. 2002) showed that a farm converted to
mixed dairy and pig production, using an array of grain
crops for harvest and grass and legume forage species for
animal feed, could obtain total self-sufficiency in animal
fodder while reducing nitrogen contamination of local
groundwater systems to very low levels as compared to conventional systems and organic livestock operations more
dependent on imported feed.


**Improving Soil Health**
The key component of a healthy soil is soil organic matter. Many factors, organisms, and interactions drive organic
matter quantity and quality, with soil health manifested in
tilth, structure, water holding capacity, and resistance to
both compaction and erosion. Long-term cultivation generally leads to the breakdown of soil organic matter, with
accompanying degradation of the indicators of soil health.
However, bringing livestock into the cropping system in
the form of a rotated grazed forage not only reduces the
need for cultivation, it also adds nutrient- and energy-rich
organic matter. Soil microbial activity increases, soil structure improves, and nutrient retention and availability favor
better crop development. In some regions, especially the
midwestern areas of the United States and Canada, the
inclusion of a perennial forage in cropping system rotations, with its accompanying respite from the negative
impacts of tillage and restoration of soil health parameters,
can easily justify the reduction in emphasis on cash grain
crops (Clark 2004).


**Providing Work**
Fueled by the matter and energy in the plant biomass they
consume, animals are able to provide work in the form of
cultivation and transport. This was discussed earlier, but it
is important to note that the work performed by animals is a
form of biological cultural energy. As such, it helps the farmer
achieve more favorable ratios of energy input to energy output


Animals in Agroecosystems **247**



and reduce purchased energy inputs (see Chapter 20). The use
of draft animals may seem anachronistic in today’s world,
but the rising cost of fossil-fuel-derived energy makes it an
increasingly attractive option. A different kind of “work” is
provided by honeybees—when kept on the farm to produce
honey as a marketable product, they also pollinate crops or
fruit trees.


**Managing Vegetation and Controlling Weeds**
Weed management appears to be a particularly important
reason why farmers include forages in their crop rotations.
In a farmer survey conducted in Canada, it was found that
more than 80% of the 235 farmers contacted reported reduction in weed pressure following forages (Entz et al. 1995).
Many observed good control of several of the most problematic weeds such as wild oat ( _Avena fatua_ L.), Canada thistle
( _Cirsium arvense_ L.), wild mustard ( _Sinapis arvensis_ L.), and
green foxtail ( _Setaria viridis_ [L.] Beauv.).

Grazing animals can be used in other ways for landscape
and vegetation management. Goats are used for poison oak
( _Toxicodendron diversilobum_ ) control in many places of
coastal California, or for weed suppression in crop systems
at the end of harvest. Sheep are known to have been used for
weed control in crops like corn before the advent of modern
herbicides in parts of the corn belt of the United States,
and chickens are renowned for their ability to cultivate the
soil, manage pests, and control weeds in home garden and
small-scale cropping systems. Managed appropriately, cattle, sheep, and goats can be used to graze out undesirable
species during reforestation, on young Christmas tree
farms, and on rangelands. Obviously the preference that
most grazing livestock have for herbaceous rather than
woody vegetation would be a key factor in the preferential removal of herb pressure in plantations of young trees
or in regenerating forests following disturbance. The use
of grazing livestock for vegetation management has strong
resemblance to the impacts of natural grazing in places
such as the midwestern prairies of North America and the
Serengeti Plain mentioned earlier in this chapter.


**Increasing Subsequent Crop Yields in Rotations**
One of the many benefits of including a grazed forage in
crop rotations is that higher yields may be obtained from the
crops planted after the forage. This effect is due to the other
positive impacts of the grazed forage period: less soil disturbance, increased soil organic matter, and weed control. In
the Canadian farmer survey noted earlier, over two-thirds
of the surveyed farmers reported higher yields in the grain
crops that were planted following the forage rotation (Entz
et al. 1995).


**Providing Ecosystem Services**
From an ecosystem perspective, animals on the agricultural
landscape can provide many services beyond food production. Many of the benefits listed earlier contribute to various
larger-scale ecological processes:




  - **Carbon sequestration.** Livestock animals are a

part of putting cover back on the land, as trees in silvopastoral systems or as perennial forage crops, two
of the few known ways to produce a net increase
in soil organic carbon, potentially making a contribution to reducing levels of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere.

  - **Erosion control.** As integral parts of a grazed forage

rotation, animals help improve the quality of vegetative cover, a crucial tool in soil erosion control.

  - **Maintenance of watershed health.** The same fac

tors that help in erosion control also promote the
watershed processes of infiltration, percolation, and
water retention discussed in Chapter 9.

  - **Biodiversity protection.** The integration of animals

back into the agricultural landscape—especially
small livestock and locally adapted species and
races—promotes the conservation of agrobiodiversity. In addition, to the extent that animals provide
other environmental services and lessen the negative off-farm impacts of agriculture, they enhance
and protect biodiversity and the entire landscape.


**S** **ocial** **and** **E** **conomic** **B** **enefits** **of** **I** **ntegration**


Up to this point we have focused mostly on the ecological
benefits of mixed livestock–crop systems. As we have seen in
many other cases, practices that have ecological benefits often
have economic and social benefits as well, and livestock–
crop integration is a good case in point. Many economic and
social benefits, of course, are implicit in the aforementioned
points made: increasing crop yields, improving soil health,
and reducing costly purchased inputs all have direct positive
impacts on the farmer’s bottom line. But two socioeconomic
benefits of integration deserve discussion on their own.


**Diversifying Enterprises and Reducing**
**Economic Vulnerability**
One of the original reasons why animals and crops were raised
together on farms was that this mixing allowed a greater diversity of food types and agricultural products to be produced.
This diversification had a simple economic logic: it increased
economic security by spreading the risk of failure among more
enterprises. While this was based on a self-sufficiency situation long gone in most parts of the world today, the same logic
still applies in the context of producing food as a commodity.
Raising animals in addition to crops provides the farmer with
additional marketable products, whether they be eggs, milk,
wool, honey, silk, lambs, or beef cattle. Depending on local
market conditions, these animal-based enterprises can provide
a valuable income stream and protect against crop failures and
market fluctuations (Schierea et al. 2002).

Further, the various enterprises that may be based on an
integrated farm are often ideal for marketing on a local or
regional basis. By selling products at local stores, restaurants, and farmers’ markets, and through food cooperatives
and community-supported agriculture organizations, the


**248** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



money that would otherwise go to distributors, wholesalers,
transporters, and brokers goes to the farmer instead. We will
discuss the importance of such localized food networks in
more detail in Chapter 25.


**Alleviating Poverty in Developing Countries**
Mixed crop–livestock systems are ideally suited to help alleviate poverty in developing countries, the underlying cause
of high infant mortality, chronic hunger, food insecurity,
resource degradation, and the high societal costs that result
from these problems. Integrated crop–livestock systems can
be operated profitably on a small scale, comprise a multiplicity of income-producing activities, and require few off-farm
inputs and relatively small capital investment; for these reasons they are effective and realistic ways of creating greater
economic security for many people in developing countries
(LEISA 2005) (Figure 19.11).

The animal portion of the system itself represents much
of the economic value to poor farmers. A livestock animal
is a living bank. It acts as a storehouse of capital, an investment in future productivity, and an insurance against crop
production risks. Where diets tend to be protein and calorie
deficient, livestock animals supply vital protein-rich food. In
addition, since women often play an important role in animal
husbandry activities, agricultural systems that incorporate
livestock animals can promote gender equality, both socially
and economically.

In many developing countries, mixed crop–livestock systems are already primary economic activities in rural areas,
but these systems operate inefficiently, without taking advantage of all the potential synergies, and as a result they don’t
realize their full potential for economic return. This is the
case in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, for example, where
a study determined that several different alternative modes of

and construction materials, and the cattle provide meat and milk.
Systems such as this, combining agriculture, animal husbandry,
and forestry, are especially appropriate for smallholders in developing countries. (Photo by Molly Wilson.)



structuring the typical smallholder agroecosystem could result
in significant improvement of the socioeconomic status of the
tribal farmers (Ramrao et al. 2005). In every case, the alternative system involved diversification and increase of the animal
component and tighter integration of all system components.

Table 19.2 compares mixed crop–livestock systems,
grazing systems, and industrial confinement systems in
terms of three important characteristics. It demonstrates
the high correlation between crop–livestock integration,
ecological qualities, and potential for achieving social and
economic equity.


**LIVESTOCK AND FOOD-SYSTEM**

**SUSTAINABILITY**


Integrating livestock and crop production carries with it a
wide variety of benefits to farms, farmers, developing countries, the agricultural landscape, and the environment in general, as the preceding section clearly demonstrates. It offers
means of reversing many of the trends currently undermining the ecological and social-system foundations of agriculture. Increasing crop–livestock integration, therefore, is a
key element of moving toward greater sustainability of the
global food system. But in doing so we face a huge challenge,
because the momentum of change is in the other direction.

To better understand this challenge, we need to look at
livestock production generally, in the context of the whole
food system. This gets us into issues that go beyond farmlevel integration of livestock and crops. It is not the intention
of this chapter to delve into these issues in any detail, but noting them briefly here will prepare the ground for their further
discussion in Section VI.

production to consumption. Livestock are raised in energetically wasteful and ecologically damaging ways; the products
derived from them reach the consumers only after traveling
long distances; and at the consumer end, high demand for
these products drives the whole system. To move toward a
more sustainable animal protein economy, change must
occur at the three levels of production, distribution, and
consumption.


**Production**

Throughout, this chapter has supported the idea that producing meat, milk, and eggs in integrated farming systems
is more sustainable than producing the same products in
specialized, single-purpose, industrial systems. But it is
unrealistic to expect all the animal protein in human diets
worldwide to come from such systems. Therefore, it is important to mention two universally applicable principles for the
more sustainable production of animal protein:


  - Energetically speaking, animals vary in the effi
ciency with which they convert plant food into
animal protein. Producing chicken flesh, chicken
eggs, and bovine milk are three of the most efficient
ways to convert plant biomass into animal protein.
Sustainability, therefore, depends on shifting the
focus of animal production toward chicken flesh,
eggs, and milk and away from the flesh of cattle.

  - There is a significant difference between feeding

beef and dairy cattle processed grain and feeding
them plant biomass that humans can’t eat. The former is an extremely inefficient use of arable land
and requires a much larger fossil-fuel subsidy. In a
sustainable food system, therefore, all ruminants
used for meat or milk production would be range
fed. Similarly, all hogs would be fed mostly on food
and crop wastes.


**Consumption**
The growth of CAFOs, and the disintegration of livestock
and crop production generally, is driven largely by a rapidly increasing demand for meat and other animal products
worldwide. People in developed countries are today eating more meat than they ever did historically. At the same
time, people in developing countries are trying to match the
prodigious meat consumption of their developed-country

counterparts.

While it is beyond the scope of this chapter to address this
issue, we must be aware that the trend toward more meatintensive diets may be the single most serious barrier to creating a more sustainable food system. There is no question,
therefore, that per-capita meat consumption must be reduced.
At the same time, the meat that is eaten must be produced
in a way that minimizes its negative impacts. This means
eating less beef and pork and relying more on poultry, milk,
and eggs. It means preferring meat from animals fed in integrated and pasture systems over meat from animals raised in
CAFOs.



**Distribution**

In the present food system, food commodities are typically
transported over long distances before they are finally consumed, using large amounts of fossil fuels and ensuring that
most of each consumer dollar goes to processors, distributors, brokers, wholesalers and other “middlemen” instead of
to the farmer. For alternatives to this distribution system—
more localized food networks—to become stronger and more
prevalent, there must be tighter geographic and economic
connections between the producers of animal products and
the consumers of those products.

Production of livestock on integrated farms is well suited
to this transformation. Such production is necessarily smaller
scale than production in CAFOs. High-volume, centralized
CAFO production goes hand in hand with a high-volume,
centralized processing and distribution system designed to
distribute eggs and meat and dairy products to a national and
even global market. Correspondingly, the low-volume, geographically dispersed production from individual integrated
farms fits best with a more local processing and distribution
system (Figure 19.12).


**C** **hallenging** **S** **pecialization** **in** **A** **griculture**


Not so long ago, the concept of specialization was unknown
to farmers. Integration and enterprise diversification were
the underlying principles of farm operation. As we lost this
approach to food production, our communities lost their local
food distribution systems and most of their family farms, and
consumers lost the organic connection with both the people

**SPECIAL TOPIC: AQUACULTURE**

Given that most of the food humans consume comes from agricultural production, and has for a long time, harvesting
wild fish from oceans, lakes, and streams can be seen as a holdover from prehistory, when all humans were hunter–­
gatherers. But if fishing is a holdover, it’s an extremely important one. Worldwide in 2009, people ate an average of about
18.5 kg of fish per person, about half of which was wild caught (FAOSTAT 2013). In many countries in central Africa,
south Asia, and Oceana, wild-caught fish and shellfish contribute more than a third of the total animal protein intake.
Capture fisheries, therefore, play a crucial role in the world food system.

But capture fisheries, in general, are in decline around the world. Although the total catch of wild fish globally has
remained relatively stable for about the last 20 years (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture 2012), this aggregate figure masks
many worrisome trends. More and more fisheries worldwide are classified as overexploited, and many, like that of
Atlantic cod, have collapsed. More than half of fisheries worldwide are considered fully exploited, which means they are
on the edge of being overfished (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture 2012). Only an increase in the volume of fish caught in
inland fisheries (mostly in Asia) has prevented the total worldwide wild fish harvest from declining.

While the global catch of wild-caught fish has remained at approximately the same level from year to year for some
time, consumption of fish has increased rapidly worldwide. Since 1961, the supply of food derived from fish has increased
an average of 3.2% per year. This increase has nearly doubled the average per-capita consumption of fish during this time
(FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture 2012).

Where are all the extra fish coming from, if not from oceans, lakes, and rivers? They are produced by aquaculture,
the “farming” of fish. Since the 1980s, aquaculture has grown very rapidly, filling the widening gap between the demand
for fish and the supply of wild fish. The contribution of aquaculture to fish production for human consumption increased
from 9% in 1980 to 47% in 2010 (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture 2012). Projections vary somewhat, but experts agree
that by 2018 the bulk of the fish consumed worldwide will be coming from fish farms.

Aquaculture is practiced in many forms. The basic requirement is that the fish be confined in some way. When farmed
fish are raised in ponds or tanks, they require a steady input of freshwater to provide adequate oxygen and to flush waste.
To eliminate the need for this “irrigation” water, many fish farmers raise the fish in cages placed in rivers, estuaries,
nearshore areas, or the open ocean, where natural water flows or tidal action provides the needed water movement. An
important factor is how the fish are fed. Some farmed species, including many shellfish and carp, don’t require feeding by
their human keepers because they are filter feeders, able to remove algae, plankton, or detritus from the water by straining or filtering it. To some extent, the farming of filter-feeding species (which accounts for about 30% of aquaculture
production) blurs the distinction between wild food and cultivated food.

Most farmed species, however, require external feed sources. Mostly, this food consists of low-value, wild-caught fish
that are cooked, pressed, dried, and ground into fish meal. Corn, soybean, and other agricultural products, however, are
becoming increasingly common components of aquaculture feedstocks. The farming of high-value fish that need to be
fed large quantities of other fish—salmon are good examples—closely resembles the factory farming of cattle and swine.

Overall, aquaculture is having significant negative impacts. In addition to taking up quantities of grain that could be
fed to people and helping to deplete stocks of wild fish, aquaculture is destroying many coastal environments. Vast areas
of mangrove forests, mudflats, salt marshes, and eelgrass beds have been converted to aquaculture farms. These farms
produce nitrogenous wastes that foul coastal waters, and they can no longer perform the environmental services carried out by the natural systems they replaced, which include water purification, erosion and storm-surge protection, and
serving as nurseries for a diversity of marine species (including, sometimes, the very species being raised in the farms).
Further, in capturing fry in the wild to raise, fish farms take an enormous toll on marine populations (Roberts 2012).
Many other concerns surround aquaculture, including genetic contamination of wild fish stocks by escaped, genetically
engineered fish, and high vulnerability to disease outbreaks and the disruptions of climate change.

Despite its significant drawbacks, aquaculture is here to stay. Indeed, it is possible to argue that aquaculture must be
part of the effort to develop sustainable food systems. Fish are highly nutritious and healthful, and if we can continue to
rely on fish and shellfish for a large proportion of our food, it reduces the pressure on terrestrial agroecosystems to feed
our growing population. Small-scale aquaculture systems, such as small ponds or catchments, are especially accessible
to smallholders, and can go a long way toward improving food security.

The reason that aquaculture must be part of the solution is that the future of wild fisheries is very clouded. Overfishing
and habitat-destroying fishing practices like bottom trawling have, for many fish species, created conditions under which
population recovery is impossible in the near term (Sale 2011). The increasing warming and acidity of the ocean are
likely to impact fish populations, both directly (in the case of shellfish) and by affecting nursery habitats such as coral
reefs and the planktonic basis of marine food chains. Many fisheries continue to be overexploited pushing them closer to
collapse, and increasing demand for fish ensures that pressures to overharvest will continue.


Animals in Agroecosystems **251**


For aquaculture to continue to take up the slack caused by the decline of capture fisheries, and to do so without
harming wild fish populations and aquatic and coastal marine habitats, it must change. Much in the same way that
agroecosystems must be made to function on the basis of ecological principles, aquaculture systems must be designed to
complement and work in concert with surrounding natural ecosystems. Many examples of sustainable aquaculture systems already exist. Basic strategies include focusing more on filter-feeding species and those than can eat algae, limiting
the scale and geographic extent of fish farms, raising fish and crustaceans at lower densities, and integrating aquaculture
with terrestrial and wetland agroecosystems (Figure 19.13).


**FIGURE 19.13** **An aquaculture pond for raising tilapia in Nacajuca, Tabasco, Mexico.** In this area of high rainfall and a high
water table, aquaculture is an excellent option of producing large quantities of protein, while at the same time providing a good source
of income for local smallholder farmers. Crops are grown on the adjacent platforms built up during the construction of the ponds. This
is a good example of sustainable aquaculture.



who produced their food and the animals from which much
of it came. Today, with livestock animals sequestered into
CAFOs, fed with grains produced half a continent away,
and their carcasses, eggs, and milk transported hundreds
and thousands of miles to market, it’s not surprising that the
typical consumer gives no thought to what it took to get the
steak to his or her table.


As we have seen elsewhere in this book, specialization
in agriculture is ill designed to meet the multiple needs
of society for abundant, healthy food, produced in ecologically sound ways that provide sustainable livelihoods.
Reintegration of livestock and crops helps reverse the
trend toward specialization and economic concentration in
agriculture, pointing the way toward more local food distribution networks, viability for smaller-scale, family-run
farms, and more self-contained, closed-loop agroecosystems
that don’t rely so strongly on purchased inputs.

Reintegrating livestock and crop production really strikes
at the heart of what’s not sustainable in conventional agriculture. For this reason, supporting the integration of livestock
and crops—in the marketplace, at research institutions, and
in the public policy arena—can go a long way toward making change happen. Such advocacy underlines the need for



integration while increasing awareness of the huge social
and environmental costs of specialization and concentration.


**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**


1. What changes would consumers need to make in

their diets in order to promote the reintegration of
animals into farming systems?
2. Can vegetarianism and integrated livestock–crop

production systems be combined?
3. What are some of the primary indicators of sustain
ability most appropriate for the analysis of integrated farming systems?
4. How can we reconcile production needs with the

ethical treatment of animals?
