## chapter 25. Community and Culture in the Remaking of the Food System

In his book _Radical Agriculture_, published in 1976, Rich Merrill wrote about the need to “get culture back into agriculture” (Merrill 1976). His was an early voice calling attention to the negative effects of a process that had already been under way for decades: the transformation of agriculture into agribusiness.

Merrill was playing with the dual meaning of _culture_, substituting the meaning having to do with the tilling of the soil with the meaning we have in mind when we use the phrase _human culture_ . In this latter sense, culture is an integrated system of human knowledge, belief, and behavior. So Merrill was essentially warning us that agriculture was being drained of its humanity—that the values, behaviors, and social relationships that once supported a stewardship orientation to farmland were falling away.

Now, four decades later, Merrill’s plea is as relevant as ever. The agribusiness model, with its drive toward industrialization of food production, has been remarkably successful by many measures, but it has completely changed the social and economic relationships surrounding the production and consumption of food. In reducing farmers to sources of farm products, farmworkers to labor costs, and the purchasers and eaters of food to consumers, it has ensured that the real people who populate our food systems will interact only through the medium of money, in a system organized to meet the demands of capital and little else.

Agriculture hasn’t lost its grounding in human culture, as one reading of Merrill’s statement might suggest; the problem is that the new beliefs, behavior, and relationships that have grown up in developed countries around the production and consumption of food have become major obstacles to sustainability, as well as being threats to public health. Consumers have no idea where the food they eat comes from or how their choices affect agroecosystems, the environment, and farmers and farmworkers. “Eating is an agricultural act,” according to Wendell Berry, but consumers eat as if they are only satisfying their hunger—or, perhaps, asserting their social status or compensating for other fundamental needs not being well met. On the production side, farmers are increasingly at the mercy of a system that separates them from consumers and leaves them little choice but to play by agribusiness rules, often at the expense of their values.

In order to be sustainable, agriculture needs a “culture” surrounding it that promotes sustainable practices rather than helping to destroy them. To put this kind of culture back into agriculture, we need to reestablish the connections between farm and table, form human relationships around food that are more than economic, and promote values in relation to

food consumption that look beyond narrow self-interest. This is one of the major challenges that define the social-change aspect of agroecology.

**WIDENING GULF BETWEEN**

**GROWING AND EATING**

Thousands of years ago, when human cultures depended primarily on hunting and gathering, people’s relationship with food was more direct, immediate, and personal than we can possibly appreciate today. Eating was necessarily grounded directly in the local environment, and each individual knew precisely where every morsel of food came from and how it came to be food—indeed, if you hadn’t gathered or trapped or killed the food yourself, someone you knew had done so. The knowledge and technologies involved in food getting were the very foundation of culture.

With the advent of agriculture, the human relationship with food began to change. Most agricultural societies developed some specialization of labor: a portion of the population could grow sufficient food to feed the rest, “freeing” some people to engage in other tasks. This was the first step in the separation between the production of food and its consumption, but for millennia the dissociation was not extreme. Every member of a society knew generally where his or her food came from, was likely to acquire it directly from the person who produced it, understood how local weather affected the food supply, and so on. Food was necessarily local and expressed the uniqueness of each place. Since different foods were domesticated in different parts of the world (see Chapter 15), there arose remarkable diversity in diets, consumption patterns, and cuisines (Figure 25.1).

As agricultural societies became ever more complex and urban, and trade between regions more extensive, the geographic, ecological, economic, and social distance between growing and eating grew much wider. Once shipbuilding technology and navigation advanced far enough to allow oceans to be crossed, domesticated species spread rapidly beyond the confines of their areas of origin. Maize and potatoes came to the Old World, rice and wheat to the New. Sweet potatoes spread through the warmer parts of Asia. At the same time, trade in grain, pulses, fiber, leather, sugar, tobacco, and other agricultural products grew rapidly. As the universe of what was available to eat expanded for many people, cultures grew less distinct in their diets, and in the quantities and qualities of the foods they consumed. At the same time, an often complex distribution apparatus increasingly insinuated itself between the grower and the eater. Food items passed

convenient and pleasing to the palate. As the world population becomes increasingly urban and many people gain more disposable income, they want to eat more meat and fish, and more of the wide array of processed, convenience, and fastfood items now on the market. The global food system is happy to oblige, especially since the foods for which demand is growing are also those with the highest profit margins.

But a global food system designed to accommodate and encourage demand for diverse, palate-pleasing, convenient food brings with it a variety of negative consequences for

consumers:

**FIGURE 25.1** **A traditional Maya home garden in José Maria** **Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico.** A wide array of subsistence crops are grown in such gardens, including fruits, vegetables, kitchen herbs, medicinal plants, and even small livestock such as chickens, ducks, and local breeds of pigs. Growing and raising food for one’s own family and community was once a commonplace around the world; now, with more and more people living in cities and rural populations increasingly caught up in production for distant markets, subsistence agriculture has become the exception rather than the rule.

from trader to broker to merchant in their lengthening journey from field to table, their prices and social meaning determined by the impersonal forces of the market.

This process has continued to the present day to produce the corporate-dominated global food system described in the previous chapter. Increasingly, food has become a commodity, bought and sold on a market that is increasingly global in scope. At the same time, the number of linkages between the grower of the food and the person who consumes it has increased over time, widening the social as well as the geographic distance between them. Because of these dynamics, we have reached a point where the act of eating, for a large number of people in the world, is completely divorced from the basic agricultural act of growing the food. This situation is attractive on the surface—the world’s more affluent people get to enjoy an amazing cornucopia of foodstuffs at relatively low prices and without dirtying their hands in the soil—but it comes with a variety of consequences. Most notably, it stands as one of the most significant barriers to sustainability.

**G** **lobal** **S** **upermarket**

From the standpoint of food choice and availability, consumers in much of the world have never had it better. Raw materi als are purchased from farmers at low prices, converted into an incredible array of processed, packaged, and preserved food items that hardly resemble the products they were made from, and distributed all over the world. Consumers, for their part, avidly embrace the ready availability of food that is

- _Food is less nutritious_ . When surviving transport

and storage is the major consideration, the breeding (or genetic engineering) process that produces the seeds is likely to have sacrificed taste and nutritive content. In addition, food that must survive longdistance transport and storage is subjected to a variety of processes—overcooking, drying, freezing, vacuum packing, pasteurization, and irradiation— that tends to remove its nutrients.

- _Food is less healthy_ . Packaged and processed foods

have added preservatives and a variety of other added ingredients—such as salt, sugar, and fats— that are linked to obesity, cancer, and other health problems. Most produce contains detectable levels of pesticides.

- _Food is standardized and homogenized_ . Regional

and cultural differences in cuisine and diet are

slowly disappearing with the homogenization of the food supply. Fast-food chains insure that a burger purchased in Tokyo is virtually identical to one bought in Chicago. Related to this is the loss of place-based identity. The regional foods that define the places we live in are either being lost or overly hyped as marketing tools.

- _Food is emptied of meaning_ . When food consump tion is completely detached from the processes that got it to our tables, when we lose all connection with the people who grow our food and with all the biological and social facts of the food’s existence, eating is stripped of much of the context and meaning it has had since the long-ago origins of the human species.

**I** **solated** **C** **onsumers**

A large number of consumers in developed and developing countries alike accept the trade-offs of the global supermarket without much thought—if they are even aware that tradeoffs exist. They eat without knowing where their food comes from or how it is grown, without any conception of how their

Community and Culture in the Remaking of the Food System **317**

choices encourage the degrading of the natural resource base and with little awareness of how their eating leads to health problems and shortened life spans.

Consumers’ inability to understand these connections springs in part from their status as mere consumers. Isolated from the production and distribution process, consumers are also isolated from the information and knowledge that might allow them to become more conscious of the workings of the food system and the negative impacts their diets and food choices have on the environment and on their own bodies. In

its place, they are surrounded by advertising that fetishizes eating as a lifestyle, glorifies consumer choice, and obscures the commodification that is involved in putting food products before them. Agribusiness corporations spend huge sums manipulating consumer tastes and behaviors in a variety of ways, taking advantage of hardwired human desires for fatty foods and sweets and the often-frenetic lifestyles adopted by those chasing after higher status and living standards. The result is twofold: an obsession with food as a product and with the act of consumption, and a systematic erasure of food’s origin and path to the supermarket shelf (Figure 25.2).

One consequence of consumer isolation is a shift away from eating as the satisfaction of nutritional needs. Immersed in a cultural context that makes eating a matter of pleasure and presents them with palate-pleasing foods high in fat, salt, and sugar, many people consume far more calories than they need. Given this reality, it is no wonder that obesity has become a problem, along with the associated health problems of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. In 2010, 35.7% of the population in the United States over 20 years was obese, another 6.3% extremely obese, and at least 33% overweight (Fryar et al. 2012). These statistics represent what is nearly a doubling of obesity rates since the late 1980s, which parallels what has occurred in the world as a whole (WHO 2013). Although increasingly sedentary lifestyles are partly to blame, a major reason for the increase in obesity is an increase in consumption of sugar- and fat-laden, energydense, processed foods.

**FIGURE 25.2** **Shopper in a typical supermarket.** The consumer has many food choices, but the only information conveyed by the labels is price. Origin, conditions of production, date of harvest, the farmer’s share of the profit, and other facts remain unknown.

**M** **arginalized** **F** **armers**

One would think that with the development of diverse and dynamic market structures for food and changes in diets, farmers would be enjoying a time of plenty. But farmers themselves are increasingly being left behind as the agricultural sector changes, unable to share in its fortunes. Although some individual farmers are doing very well indeed, most are facing daunting challenges. Globally, the trend is toward larger and larger farming operations operated under the dictates of the industrial food system, with shrinking roles for farmers traditionally conceived of as stewards of the land.

The marginalization of farming has serious social and demographic consequences for rural communities. As we saw in Chapter 1, rural farm communities are in decline around the world. Once thriving assemblages of people from all walks of life, livelihoods, and outlooks, today they are increasingly aging and depopulating. In the United States, less than 1% of the population is made up of full-time farmers, and of those, farmers over 65 years old outnumber those under 35 years by nearly seven to one (USDA 2007). In many developing countries, farmers and their families are leaving rural areas and their farms in alarming numbers, forced out by increasingly untenable circumstances or attracted to opportunities, imagined or real, in cities.

Of course, the declining number of farmers does not mean that there has been a decline in the importance of the farm sector. The world still has to eat, and there are 70 million more mouths to feed each year. What allows current world agriculture to produce greater amounts of food with declining involvement by farmers is farm modernization. Simply put, this is the substitution of tractors for people. To produce copious quantities of food, industrial-scale operations require business managers, technicians, and often low-wage farmworkers, not farmers.

In the developing world, the movement of people from countryside to city and the concomitant rise in the size of farming operations had a later start than it did in the United States and Europe. This is why many countries in the world still have very substantial rural populations and why half of the world’s people still depend on farming for their livelihoods. In some parts of the world, such as much of South Asia, over 70% of the people are farmers, and in these regions, agriculture accounts in many places for half of the total economic activity (FAO 2013b). Because they can offset the growing dependence on imported food, rural populations in developing countries hold the greatest hope for improving conditions of food security on a long-term sustainable basis.

Farmers have always had to contend with unfavorable weather, voracious pests, and unpredictable markets for their crops. But the rise of industrial agriculture has introduced additional threats that are often even more difficult to overcome. Increasingly, the capture of food production and

**318** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

agricultural capital by agribusiness puts smaller-scale farmers into positions in which they are at a distinct disadvantage.

Recall the discussion in Chapter 1 about how most of the consumer food dollar goes to the processing, shipping, and marketing side of the food system, leaving farmers with less than 16¢ of every food dollar spent. This by itself is a major reason for the decline of the farming occupation—as a basic economic reality it leaves farmers with little option but to “get big or get out.” But the more than 84% share of the consumer food dollar going to the processing, packaging, shipping, and marketing middlemen indicates just how much our food system has changed (this share was well under 50% in 1919) and how thoroughly it is now stacked against the smallscale farmer.

With much of the profit in the “marketing” segment of agriculture, it’s no surprise that most of the processing, brokerage, shipping, packaging, and marketing functions are performed by transnational corporations and the firms they own or control. Further, these large corporations have taken full advantage of vertical integration—each owns firms at every link in the food-system chain, from seeds to shipping to processing to distribution to marketing. Over time, there has been a tendency for the overall number of these firms to decrease. This economic concentration, combined with vertical integration, allows a relative handful of agribusiness corporations to dominate the agricultural sector of most nations’ economies (see Table 25.1).

The farmer, therefore, faces a virtual agricultural oligopoly. For example, consider a typical corn farmer in the US Midwest buying seed for next year’s crop. That farmer has little choice of what seed to buy and who to buy it from, because he or she is confronted with a system where the only buyer of corn in the region is a large transnational corporation that is in partnership with another large corporation that provides seeds for the only variety of corn that the buyer will purchase. The bank that provides the production loan most likely is part of the same transnational’s portfolio, and will probably have the same requirements of which seed variety to use, and recommend very highly or even require that the farmer use fertilizers and pesticides from sources the transnational also owns or controls. Once the farmer has grown the corn, and does not want to sell to the transnational at the fixed price, he or she could choose to feed the corn to hogs for sale at auction. But the transnational will be there bidding on the hogs as well. And finally, if the farmer gives up and decides to plant a crop other than corn, he or she will find that there are very few if any other crops that are not controlled by the system of food “cartels” (Halweil 2004).

There is little room for small-scale or family farmers in a system in which the farmers’ product is a commodity in a global market controlled by vertically integrated transnationals. Therefore, such farmers are increasingly forced to sell out. Their land is eagerly bought up by developers, or by the larger-scale farmers who have learned to adapt to the

system.

One common way of “adapting” to the system is to grow under contract for the larger and larger corporations formed

by the mergers and consolidations that are common in the marketplace. The USDA Economic Research Service, using data from the Agricultural Census of 2007, found that more than 40% of American agricultural output is produced under contract, including 68% of hogs and 90% of poultry (O’Donoghue et al. 2011). This does not include contracts that farmers must sign to plant genetically engineered seeds (see Chapter 15). When the control of the food system becomes so centralized, the farmer is essentially reduced to a hired hand in a commodity chain. We end up with large-scale farms managed by distant corporations interested in extracting the maximum output at the minimum cost.

In developing countries, farmers are increasingly affected by the double impacts of cheap, heavily subsidized imports of foods from outside of their traditional local markets, coupled with exclusion from opportunities to sell their products

According to conventional wisdom, agricultural modernization and larger-scale farming improves the efficiency of the food system—bigger farms can produce more at lower economic costs; production and equipment costs can be spread over greater area, inputs purchased at bulk rates, and loans negotiated at lower interest. Such advantages are indeed increasingly important as agriculture becomes more capital intensive. However, as we have seen throughout this book, most of the ecological elements of sustainability on farms are lost or compromised as the scale becomes too large.

**FIGURE 25.3** **A monoculture of pineapples growing near** **Buenos Aires, Costa Rica, in an area once covered by tropical** **rain forest.** Fruit will be exported through a vertically integrated commodity chain, where a transnational owns or controls most of the steps from the field to the table.

for export to distant markets. With weak local market systems and little support from national agricultural research or extension, small farmers have little incentive or opportunity to maintain viable livelihoods from farming. The paradox inherent in this situation is that the largest percentage of the approximately 850 million hungry people in the world are from rural and farming communities. With the added pressure of producing for markets when they can, and then receiving an unfair return for their efforts, they are pressured to plant even more of the cash crops in order to try to bring in more income. Land and crops that would otherwise be used for local consumption and markets are abandoned, and if prices for their export crops plummet, as they often do, they are left with few options (Figure 25.3).

**C** **onsequences** **for** **S** **ustainability**

The food system just described—in which food is grown in large-scale agroecosystems as a commodity in a global market for consumers completely isolated from the production process—has an enormous bearing on sustainability. All the unsustainable on-the-ground practices of present-day industrial agriculture described in Chapter 1—monoculture, intensive tillage, reliance on external inputs, planting of hybrid and genetically engineered seeds, and so on—exist in part because of how well they serve this food system. When food is a mere commodity and the only goal of its production is extraction of profit, unsustainable practices flourish. Farms grow larger, industrial methods of production dominate, and more sustainable smaller-scale, traditional, and agroecologically based practices are marginalized.

As a result, what were once self-regulating systems for transforming solar energy, moving nutrients, balancing member populations, and maintaining a dynamic equilibrium through time have become management-intensive systems dependent on nonrenewable fossil-fuel energy, synthetic chemical fertilizer inputs, and external population-regulating practices.

Small-scale farmers are the best stewards of the natural

resource base upon which their farms function; they are the only ones with extensive knowledge of local soils, weather, land races, noncrop plants, pollinators, local sources of soil amendments, ecosystem characteristics, and community needs. If the ecological costs of industrial-scale farming are taken into account, it turns out that for many crops actual production costs are lower when the crops are grown on relatively smaller farms. But because this kind of cost accounting is not part of the industrial system, small-scale farmers lose out. When they leave their farms, their knowledge and stewardship values go with them.

While sustainability takes its most direct hit from the simple decline in the number of small-scale, family farms, that decline in numbers also has indirect effects. When the econo mies of rural communities decline, their social fabric begins to unravel as well. This unraveling has been documented in the powerful writings of many authors (e.g., Wendell Berry, Gene Logsdon, Donald Worster, Wes Jackson). When a way of life is restricted to merely making a living, many of the reasons for being and doing are lost. When a person feels like he or she is nothing more than a link in a commodity chain, and less a member of a vibrant, interactive, and healthy community, the indicators of decline appear. Poverty, crime, high school dropout rates, spousal and child abuse, mental stress, and substance abuse—all signs of social dysfunction—soon approach levels similar to those of crowded urban areas. The consequences are ecological as much as they are social, affecting the farmers, their communities, and the landscapes in which they live. When farmers no longer have the incentive, desire, or ability to be good stewards of the land, ecological degradation is an inevitable outcome.

**EATING SUSTAINABLY**

Although consumers in general are isolated from the growing of food, largely ignorant about how the food system functions, and mostly unaware of the extent to which advertising shapes their eating and food-buying choices, they are not hapless pawns of the industrial food system. Consumers, as eaters of food, can act independently and choose to eat differently, in ways that break out of the mold established by the industrial food system. This is becoming increasingly easy and increasingly common as information about the ecological and health effects of mainstream diets becomes more widespread and as practical alternatives to participation in the industrial food system develop and spread.

**320** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

Changing how we eat is a key part of transforming the food system into one that is more sustainable and more equitable. This is true in two distinct but related ways. First, the earth simply cannot support nine billion people all trying to eat like affluent Americans do. In fact, it can’t even come close to doing this, which makes sustainable eating an ecological imperative. Second, sustainable eating habits have a feedback effect on the food system: they put pressure on the food system to change, and they allow and support the growth of more sustainable alternatives. In this sense, eating sustainably is a kind of grassroots way of provoking food-system change.

**D** **ietary** **T** **rends**

For many decades, consumers in developed countries have had unsustainable diets. Eating large amounts of animalderived food, processed food, and food traveling long distances from farm to table, they support the many practices of industrial agriculture described in Chapter 1, which entail enormous fossil-fuel-based energy subsidies, use of valuable land for growing livestock feed, commodity-scale production, overuse of precious water resources, and pollution of the environment. Not surprisingly, people in developing countries aspire to having similar diets. As the reach of the globalized food system expands, capturing the markets and imaginations of consumers around the world, and as incomes rise among an increasingly urbanized middle class in developing countries, dietary patterns all over the world are becoming increasingly unsustainable. The biggest change has been a large increase in consumption of meat, oils, fish, eggs, and dairy products in places where they had been limited before. In China, for example, total meat consumption more than doubled (from 25.7 to 58.3 kg/capita/year) between 1990 and 2009 and milk consumption increased by a factor of 6 during the same period (from 5.9 to 29.8 kg/capita/year) (FAOSTAT 2014) (Figure 25.4). Although consumption of foods with the

highest ecological costs is no longer increasing significantly in developed countries (and in some cases is declining), the huge size of the populations in developing countries that are likely to achieve middle-class living standards in the near future means that global consumption of, and demand for, these foods is going to increase, possibly dramatically.

The biggest culprits in increasing the ecological costs of diets worldwide are meat and dairy. As was described in Chapter 1, animal-based diets require an animal-based production system. The industrial model of CAFOs, with animals being fed with energy- and protein-rich grains that are produced in large monocultures at a long distance from where they are fed to the animals, has led to soil erosion, increased herbicide use, a rise in proprietary GMO seed, a loss of farmers and an increase in individual farm size, increases in carbon emissions, and massive problems of animal waste management. In developing countries with increasing demand for meat and milk, transnational corporations either establish CAFOs in those countries, with a dependence on imported feed and genetic stock, or former production systems focused on production of food for direct human consumption are reoriented to feed animals, and the countries become dependent on imported foods such as basic grains, vegetable oils, and other goods. Even small-scale animal systems in developing countries, under pressure from the shift to animal diets, sacrifice the integration that was discussed in Chapter 19.

To lower the environmental and social impacts of our food choices, we must think about the food-system implications of how we eat, and change anything that negatively impacts sustainability. The foods with the highest environmental costs—the largest ecological “foodprint”—are those transported long distances, grown in monocultures, grown in

high-input systems, and made from animals or animal products. With some foods, such as fish, other parameters come into play, such as overfishing or unhealthy farm-raised systems, but these are the basic ones. As a consumer, it can be difficult to evaluate the extent to which a particular food item expresses these characteristics. Food labels generally do not provide adequate information. Moreover, many certification programs, such as “certified organic” in the United States, do not guarantee that food bearing their labels has a substantially smaller ecological footprint than conventionally grown counterparts. “Organic” food in the United States for example, can be grown in high-input monocultures. Food choices become easier if one follows a few principles that crosscut the ecological factors involved in food production:

- _Eat lower on the food chain_ . Emphasize plant

foods over animal foods. Increasing the percentage of food consumed that involves fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, and grains promotes the most efficient use of agricultural land; as an additional benefit, it insures adequate intake of the protein, antioxidants, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins needed for health.

- _Eat real food._ Avoid highly processed foods with

the empty calories of fats and sugars, and the overuse of salt. Return to food that is fresh, grown using the agroecologically based practices and principles presented in this book, and from the hands of the farmer as much as possible.

- _Eat local_ . Eating food grown and raised in the

region in which you live helps to reconnect food producers and food eaters in a social relationship that reaches back to the land, reduces carbon emissions and promotes sustainable farming practices, and eliminates intermediaries in the market place, which recirculates money in the local economy, distributing rather than concentrating profits.

- _Eat seasonal_ . Food that is grown out of season,

either in climate controlled installations like heated

greenhouses or shipped long distances from overseas production sites, requires immense fossil-fuel subsidies and most often is not as healthy as eating the same food grown in season. Long-distance production systems are usually strictly controlled by corporate agriculture, and when located in the global South, they too often exploit the farmers and workers who grow the food. Bringing back the art of food preservation for out of season consumption can also once again be an option.

Michael Pollan summed it up well in his book _In Defense_ _of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto_ (Pollan 2008). He advised, “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” Sustainable eating is ethical (because it protects the systems that sustain life), agroecological (because it is based on ecological principles), and in the consumer’s self-interest (because it promotes good health).

As noted earlier, there is increasing support, both culturally and economically, for sustainable eating in most developed countries. By participating in the alternative food networks (AFNs) described later in this chapter, consumers in developed countries are aware of making choices that are simultaneously more ethical, more beneficial to their own health and well-being, and consistent with their social status. For many people in the world, however, the situation is rather different. In developing countries, the rising demand for meat, dairy, and imported luxury foods is inextricably linked to the broad desire for higher standards of living. For the growing numbers of middle-class people in countries such as China, India, Malaysia, Brazil, and Mexico, the ability to eat more animal-derived foods is one of the explicit goals of striving for better lives. Encouraging these people to go back to eating traditionally because it is more ecologically sound is much like asking them to return to the impoverished and disempowered conditions from which they are rising—or at least that’s how they are likely to interpret the suggestion. Similarly, the poorest people in developed countries, the urban underclass, often cannot _afford_ to eat more sustainably. Unable to grow their own food, without access to farmers’ markets and the like in their communities, and lacking the financial resources to pay the premium for sustainably grown food anyway, they consume the relatively cheap, processed and packaged food available to them. Enjoining people in such circumstances to eat more sustainably can be seen as insensitive and out of touch.

The preceding analysis indicates that we will not create a more sustainable food system simply by advocating that consumers change their behavior around food. Diet patterns are complex products of the interactions between history, social class, culturally determined values, the dynamics of the global market, and many other factors. They are bound up, too, with the corporate-dominated food system. Although the changes in eating habits we are seeing among relatively affluent people in developed countries are a hopeful sign— and a necessary part—of change, the key challenge lies in making sustainable eating something that everyone feels is desirable and everyone experiences as possible.

**F** **ood** **C** **itizenship**

In our discussion of natural ecosystems in Chapter 2, a consumer was defined as an organism that ingests other organisms (or their parts or products) to obtain nutrients and food energy. Economics texts define the consumer as one who acquires goods or services, or simply a buyer. Neither of these definitions is adequate for describing the role that a human buyer and eater of food must play in a sustainable food system.

We need a different concept, one that points to the “consumer” as informed, responsible, and engaged. The term **food** **citizen** does the job well. According to Jennifer Wilkins, food citizenship is “the practice of engaging in food-related behaviors that support, rather than threaten, the development

**322** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

of a democratic, socially and economically just, and environmentally sustainable food system” (Wilkins 2005).

People can practice food citizenship in many ways. In addition to being very intentional with one’s daily food buying in the ways discussed earlier, food citizenship can involve other actions that send signals for the need for change. One such action is requesting local or sustainably grown produce at mainstream markets and restaurants. Sometimes simply asking questions about where and how items were produced can have an effect. Other important actions include engaging in public policy development from the local to the global level, working to create a culture of sustainability, and educating others about how the present food system works to encourage unsustainable practices, consumer alienation, and agrarian decline.

There are many challenges we face in being truly good food citizens. First, the current corporate-controlled food system offers few food options that meet the criteria of local and sustainable. Secondly, current federal policy promotes a narrow range of commodities, and this has resulted in an abundance of cheap food components, rather than health or sustainability of the land or the people connected to that land. Third, institutional food-buying policies at all levels, from local to federal, make the purchase of local or sustainable food products more difficult than it should be. Fourth, we still lack a critical analysis of how health and nutrition systems have been impacted by current food market consolidation and policy. These barriers only emphasize the need for change at all levels.

Because foods with the highest ecological costs—meat, dairy products, and processed foods high in sugar and fat—are also generally those with the most negative effects on people’s health, any effort to curb consumption of these foods on the grounds of sustainability can also be an effort to improve public health. As we noted earlier, many relatively affluent consumers in developed countries—those who might self-consciously see themselves as “food citizens”—are generally aware that certain foods have both ecological harms and negative health impacts, or at least have access to the information that would bring such knowledge. In developing countries, the connections are much harder to make, for a variety of reasons.

As higher standards of living reach many people in developing countries, diets inevitably change, shifting away from traditional foods and toward increased amounts of meat, dairy, and other foods with high health and environmental costs. In many areas of the global South, one outcome of this shift is a tendency for the effects on body weight and other indicators of human health to be bimodal. Those groups with the highest levels of food insecurity show all the signs of malnutrition, with lower weight, height, and other indicators of poor nutrition. Often these people have abandoned subsistence production in favor of growing food, such as coffee, for export, but their cash income is insufficient to cover their

needs for purchased food. At the other extreme are people with indicators of obesity and a high incidence of Type 2 diabetes; typically these people have been more successful in the cash economy and have enough money to buy processed and junk food high in fats, salts, and sugars that provide empty calories and poor nutrition. The effects may be different, but they are really two sides of the same coin.

In many of those developing countries in which increasing integration with the global food system is having negative consequences for public health in the form of both malnutrition and obesity, it may be possible to mitigate the health problems and improve sustainability at the same time by revitalizing traditional farming systems and the traditional foods and diets that go with them. These systems have yet to be wholly abandoned, and their associated food culture is still part of the people’s heritage. Thus a renewed emphasis on healthy eating and local cuisine is a practical possibility. Mexico serves as a good example. Here, advertising, urbanization, and an emphasis on the most calories for the least cost have moved people away from the traditional cuisine of corn, beans, chiles, and all of the local spices and condiments that accompany them. Even the traditional _tortilla_ has changed due to the heavy infiltration of industrially produced and processed corn flour. But a growing awareness in Mexico of the rapid increase in dietary-related diseases such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes (Mexico is ranked number 1 after the United States with the most obese and overweight people) has engendered a local response to the problem (Astudillo 2014). A national strategy has now been in place for several years to educate the populace about the problem of obesity and to promote a return to healthy eating, and awareness is growing. A new tax on sugary drinks and junk food approved by the National Congress has drawn international attention to the issue. There are also local movements

to preserve the cultivation of traditional varieties of corn and the hand crafting of the tortilla as part of local eating (Figure 25.5).

**BRINGING FARMERS AND**

**CONSUMERS BACK TOGETHER**

As we have seen, strong interests have taken over the space between the farmers in the field and the eaters around the table. The dissolution of this relationship has been one of the root causes of the trend away from sustainable practices and relationships and away from healthy and sustainable eating. It follows, then, that reestablishing a closer relationship between farmers and consumers is an important part of building a path back toward sustainability. If farmers have alternatives to the agribusiness model and the food-system oligopoly, they can remain on the land and farm profitably using the best, most sustainable practices. If consumers are in touch with the food production process, they are aware of how their choices and behaviors affect the growing of food, the environment, the working of the food system, and their own health. The growing of food is as much a set of social and ecological relationships as it is farming, and

**FIGURE 25.5** **A visitor being shown how to make traditional** _**nacatamales**_ **at the community of La Pita, northern Nicaragua.** Locally grown varieties of corn are used to make special tamales with fresh vegetables, herbs, and chiles.

reestablishing the vital connection between the people on the farm and the people at the table is a critical step toward reaching back to the land, outward to the people, and forward to sustainability.

**E** **lements** **of** **an** **A** **lternative** **F** **ood** **S** **ystem**

Bringing consumers and farmers back together is really the same thing as creating an alternative food system. In such a system (1) food production and consumption has a bioregional basis; (2) the food supply chain has a minimum number of links; (3) farmers, consumers, retailers, distributors, and other actors exist in the context of an interdependent community and have the opportunity for establishing real relationships; (4) opportunities exist for the exchange of knowledge and information among all those who participate in the food system; and (5) the benefits and burdens of the alternative food system are shared equally by all participants. These aspects of an alternative food system are closely interrelated. Although they are likely to exist together, they are distinct enough that we will discuss them separately.

**Agricultural Bioregionalism** It can be said that as the physical distance between the people who grow food and the people who eat it grows, the chance for the exploitation of both grows as well. An important way to ensure that this exploitation does not happen is to bring “localness” back into agriculture.

Localness depends on physical proximity. When the people who consume food are not far from the people who produce it, that food system is local. Local food systems are

identified with a place and contribute to the environmental, social, economic, and cultural development of the communities in that place (Figure 25.6).

When the people living in a particular area or region eat mostly food that’s grown or raised locally they shift the focus of their diets. Food that can’t be grown locally is not eliminated from what they eat, but its role is reduced in favor of more local food. In temperate climates, this also implies eating what it is in season and relying more on traditional foodcaching techniques such as root cellaring, as well as food preservation and storage techniques such as drying and canning. Although this means “giving up” some of the choice and convenience we have come to expect in the global supermarket, it brings many benefits, including renewed connection to place.

The concept of the _watershed_ —an area drained by a single interconnected network of streams—plays a role in discussions of bioregionalism generally. In the context of agricultural bioregionalism, it makes sense to use the parallel concept of the **foodshed**, which can be defined as a geographically limited sphere of land, people, and businesses tied together by food relationships.

Many benefits can be derived from a food system in which foodsheds are the primary functional units. From an ecological perspective, growing and consuming food locally reduces the amount of fossil-fuel energy needed to transport food to the consumer. Less energy need be expended to process or store food once it is harvested since food can be consumed sooner following harvest. Food waste can be more easily returned to the farm, promoting nutrient cycling and reducing the dependence on outside nutrient inputs. Diversity at the level of the farm and the level of the landscape (Chapter 23) are more easily supported, creating a healthy integration of urbanized areas, working landscapes, and natural ecosystems.

Economically, local economies thrive on local food systems. Money spent on locally grown food can generate nearly twice as much income for the local economy as money spent

**324** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

on food from afar (Shuman 2006, 2012). Money recirculates within the community rather than being siphoned off by distant companies. All sectors of the community benefit from this local flow: local farmers, local businesses, local service agencies, and even local schools and hospitals. Bioregionally based agriculture, therefore, is the key element in any effort to rebuild and restore economically and socially distressed rural communities and regions.

**Shorter Food Supply Chains** One of the problematic aspects of the present global food system is the large number of “links” in the chain between the farmer and consumer. These often include brokers, processors, distributors, transporters, packagers, wholesalers, and retailers. The greater the number of links, the more disconnected the farmer and consumer, the greater the amount of the consumer food dollar siphoned away from the farmer, and the greater the demand for food production to be large scale and driven solely by production criteria.

A more sustainable alternative food system requires food supply chains with fewer links. The importance of **short food supply chains** (SFSCs) has been recognized in the area of rural development (Renting et al. 2003), and the concept is gaining attention as a component of food-system sustainability.

The shortest food supply chain is not even a chain because it has no links at all: consumption of food by the same person, family, or group who grew it. Although growing one’s own food is often rejected as impractical, it is practiced to a surprising extent all over the world, even in urban settings. From cities in China to towns all over Europe, the backyard or rooftop kitchen garden is an important source of food. Community gardens—providing gardening plots for those without access to land—are common in cities around the

world, and are becoming increasingly popular in the United States and Western Europe.

The next shortest food supply chain, of course, is provided by a direct relationship between a farmer and a consumer. These face-to-face chains occur with farmers’ markets, box schemes, roadside sales, farm stores, pick-your-own farms, and the like (Figure 25.7).

Traditional food-retailing arrangements can incorporate shorter food supply chains, too, particularly when restricted to a local foodshed. Supermarkets, food stores, restaurants, and institutions can purchase a large portion of their food direct from local growers. This adds only one link between farmer and consumer. Even if a distributor or other whole saler is involved, the links are still fewer than those that exist in the global food system, and the distance the food travels is greatly reduced.

Finally, direct or nearly direct farmer–consumer commerce can occur over greater distances, facilitated by present-day communication technology and the transportation infrastructure. Through direct-purchase cooperatives, e-commerce, and subscription plans, consumers can buy high-value products, such as coffee, directly from the farmers who grow them. Even though the products may travel

**FIGURE 25.7** **A rural farmer’s association selling organic** **produce at a market in Porto Alegre, Brazil.** More than a dozen farmers own a truck together, and take turns going to the market with their pooled products.

long distances, the long food supply chain of the global food system is effectively short circuited.

**Food-Based Community** The impersonal global food system has inexorably diminished the role of food as a cohesive force in the creation and

maintenance of communities. Because food is the most fun damental human need, humans have always come together to ensure food supplies. Throughout our biological and cultural evolution, the need to cooperate in the procurement, production, storage, distribution, and protection of food has caused humans to form hunting bands, villages, towns, cities, and societies. The religious ideas, ways of life, values and mores that have held these social formations together have always— until recently in human history—been grounded to a great extent in food.

Restoring the fundamental role of food as a bonding force for community is beneficial not just for communities, but for the food system as well. When the production, distribution, and consumption of food occurs in a community context, in which people have interdependent relationships, factors that cause imbalance in the system are more readily apparent and more easily adjusted or repaired. It becomes a community concern—something that has a potential effect on everyone—if farmland is being lost to development, if soil erosion is causing productivity declines, if too much foodrelated money is leaving the community, and if farmers are getting economically squeezed.

**Democratic Information Exchange** In separating farmers and consumers, the global food system has also fundamentally changed the nature of information exchange and communication among the actors in the system. The information that flows through the present system is mostly controlled and mediated by the corporate interests that receive up to 84% of the consumer dollar. These interests want consumers to know as little as possible about the origins,

Community and Culture in the Remaking of the Food System **325**

nutritive content, processing, and economic circumstances of the food they eat, and to be concerned as much as possible with the fetishized aspects of food consumption—how it fits into diet fads, how it is more convenient, and how it helps form one’s image and identity. What consumers “want” is thus manipulated to a great extent by the food supply oligopoly, and this information filters down to farmers as impersonal economic imperatives.

In political terms, democracy is dependent on the free flow of information and open communication. For a democracy to function effectively as the “will of the people,” the people must have full access to knowledge about alternatives, possible consequences, the lessons of the past, and so on. In contrast, coercive political systems always rely in part on restricting the flow of information and shaping what gets to count as truth and knowledge. Food systems work the same way. An alternative food system that empowers the eating public and the people who actually grow food—a _food_ _democracy_ —requires a free flow of undistorted, unfiltered information and channels of communication among the people in different parts of the system. Democratic information exchange becomes the basis for active, engaged consumers who understand the significance of their choices.

**Shared Cost Burdens and Benefits** In the democratic food system described above, the making of alternative food systems involves the development of a comprehensive “food ethic” in which every member of the food system is treated fairly and receives full recognition and reward for what he or she does. This especially applies to such people as the smallholder farmers and their families in a developing country growing an export crop to send to consumers in developed countries, to poor consumers without the financial resources to acquire enough adequate and healthy food to maintain a healthy diet, and the low-paid workers on all farms, including farms billed as organic and sustainable, who too often are migrants without access to a living wage, health care, or other necessary benefits. Meeting the needs of all of these elements of the food system, and any others where injustice or lack of fairness is obvious, is what is termed **food justice** .

As defined by Robert Gottlieb and Anapama Joshi, a food justice framework “ensures that the benefits and risks of how food is grown and processed, transported, distributed, and consumed are shared equitably” (Gottlieb and Joshi 2010). Food justice recognizes the voices and faces of the food system that have for too long been taken for granted or ignored, even with today’s understanding of the need for food-system change (Allen 2004; Gray 2014). Along with promoting local food systems, healthy diets, alternative food systems, and social change, we must also be concerned with the injustices that pervade the food system. As long as agribusiness controls the food system, farmworkers will be considered a cost of production that must be reduced or even eliminated in order to lower costs. Campesino or peasant farmers and their families will not be high on the list of priorities in a globalized food market where food sales and profits are the primary focus. Nor will the needs of resource-limited eaters in inner

cities where large supermarkets have been closed and “food deserts” created because the sales potential of these places are too low. The need for food justice is a guiding principle in the Level 4 transition process as food systems are transformed for sustainability.

**B** **uilding** **A** **lternative** **F** **ood** **N** **etworks**

Farmers, consumer cooperatives, neighborhood associations, groups advocating sustainable development, green entrepreneurs, and others have been quietly building the foundations of a more sustainable and just food system for decades. Making use of different combinations of the five elements discussed earlier, they have set up farmers’ markets, farm stores, direct-marketing schemes, food hubs, and many other types of businesses, programs, and institutions that give farmers and consumers alternatives to the global food system.

These AFNs are diverse, varying in size, scope, and intent. What they share is a desire to bring many of the missing elements of sustainability back to our food system. They provide real-world, working models of a different, decentralized approach to the ecology and economy of food, thereby helping to create a new culture of sustainability.

Like life forms, AFNs have “evolved” along different paths to exploit different niches. There are abundant niches in the local or regional context. These have been filled by farmers’ markets, community-supported agriculture schemes, other types of direct-marketing arrangements, local-food-focused restaurants, and so on. These AFNs are generally able to incorporate all five elements of alternative food systems at once: they operate in a strictly local context, create short food supply chains, build food-based community, allow for democratic information exchange, and promote food justice. Many of them are based on face-to-face contact between consumers

and producers.

But localness has its limitations. Not all farm products can be grown or produced in every farm community around the world. Climate, soils, geography, and local culture can all restrict what can be grown or raised in a certain area. Coffee, cocoa, vanilla, and mangos, for example, can only be produced in the tropics, and then only in specific parts of the tropics. Cranberries and olive oil can only be produced in temperate regions and then only in specific parts of the temperate zone. Even if they are committed to “eating locally” consumers will always want to have some available food products that are out of season or impossible to grow locally. Creating a way for consumers to purchase such products, outside of the current global food system, has been the goal of various other types of AFNs. These “extended networks” typically connect consumers and producers more directly, often through the Internet, greatly shortening the supply chain that would otherwise be involved, and at the same time promoting the democratic flow of information.

Table 25.2 lists a variety of AFNs and indicates for each type how it makes use of the five elements of alternative food systems. Some of the more important of these AFN types are discussed in more detail in the following.

**Farmers’ Markets**

At a farmer’s market, farmers, growers, or producers from a specific local area are present in person to sell their own produce directly to the public. All products sold are certified to be grown, reared, caught, brewed, pickled, baked, smoked, gathered, or processed by the seller. In the direct sale of their produce to consumers, farmers can take back some of the profits captured by the agribusiness supply chain. Perhaps even more importantly, long-term personal relationships between the farmer and consumer can develop that ultimately keep bringing the consumer back to that farmer. The public can be confident in the origins of the food, ask questions, and stay close to the source of production. The producers get valuable feedback from customers. The absence of middlemen can also mean lower prices to the consumer. Case studies from places as diverse as Costa Rica, the United Kingdom, and the United States show that a basket of produce purchased at a farmers’ market often costs less than the same products purchased commercially (Halweil 2004).

Over the past two decades, interest in farmers’ markets has soared. The number of registered farmers’ markets in the United States has grown by an order of magnitude in 30 years,

from about 300 in the mid-1970s to more than 8144 at the end

of 2013 (USDA 2014). The city of Santa Cruz, CA, with a current population of about 65,000 people, started its first certified farmers’ market in 1976. Today there is at least one market open every day in some part of the city, and on some days more than one, with many of them operating on a yearround basis. Most towns in surrounding communities outside the city limits now have their own markets as well. In the United Kingdom, a national organization provides support, representation, education, and certification for more than 550 markets (FARMA 2014). In a food system defined by standardization, mass distribution, and economies of scale, farmers’ markets seem to be ideally suited for smaller-scale and beginning farmers. These farmers have the opportunity to begin by marketing relatively small amounts of produce and experimenting with new crops and products, even when they have limited access to economic resources.

**Community Supported Agriculture** Compared to the farmers’ market model, which is actually an ancient form of direct farmer distribution, communitysupported agriculture (CSA) is a much newer innovation.

Community and Culture in the Remaking of the Food System **327**

their connection to the land and the production process is concrete and meaningful.

Many CSAs donate shares to needy families, soup kitchens, and food banks, or offer sliding-scale memberships so that their clientele are not just those with more resources. Each CSA is structured to meet the needs of the participants, so many types exist, with variation in the level of financial commitment and active participation by the shareholders, financing, land ownership, payment plans, and food distribution systems (Imhoff 2001).

**FIGURE 25.8** **Customers pick up their weekly CSA box.** Subscribers receive a box of fresh produce directly from the farmer during the growing season. (Photo courtesy of Martha Brown.)

As the name implies, the social and economic bonds associated with the CSA model differ greatly from those in the global food system.

In basic terms, a CSA consists of a community of individuals who pledge support to a farm operation so that the farmland becomes, either directly or indirectly, the community’s farm, with the growers and consumers providing mutual support and sharing the risks and benefits of food production. Typically, members or “shareholders” of the farm pledge to either pay a regular subscription cost through the season, or pay in advance to cover the anticipated costs of the farm operation and farmer’s salary. In return, members receive a weekly box or basket share in the farm’s bounty throughout the growing season (Figure 25.8).

Everyone benefits: the grower receives better prices for his or her crops, gains some financial security, and is relieved of much of the burden of marketing. Consumers receive produce that is fresher, tastier, harvested at the peak of ripeness, and also not fumigated, refrigerated, or packaged.

Beyond the obvious economic benefits of dealing directly with the customer, the CSA arrangement allows the farmer to receive working capital when it is most needed, reducing the need for bank loans and improving cash flow. The farmer also has a secure market for in-season produce and extra yields that might occur. In addition, it is not the farmer alone who takes on the risks of farming, which may include poor harvests due to unfavorable weather or pests.

While many CSA arrangements do not build in face-toface contact between the farmer and the consumer, all CSAs create abundant opportunity for the democratic flow of information. The farmer, for example, can include educational information sheets and recipes along with the produce, and members can provide feedback about produce quality and preferences. Some CSAs provide the option of actually working on the farm and getting to know farmworkers. Even when members do not participate directly in production, however,

Most CSAs offer a diversity of vegetables, fruits, and herbs in season; some provide a full array of farm produce, including eggs, meat, milk, baked goods, and even firewood. Some farms team up with others in somewhat milder climatic zones nearby so that members receive goods on a more nearly year-round basis. There is excellent opportunity for the design and management of the farm to reflect this diversity, providing opportunity and impetus for the application of the agroecological concepts and principles presented throughout this book.

The number of CSA operations in the United States has grown rapidly. The first recognized CSA began in 1985, and by the agricultural census of 2007, there were more than 12,500 (USDA 2014). In the United Kingdom, CSA-type arrangements have mushroomed in the past two decades (FARMA 2014).

**Extended Networks**

Alternatives to the global food system need not be restricted to local networks. An alternative food network that extends

beyond an agricultural bioregion can still create shorter food supply chains, allow for democratic information exchange, and even—in a virtual sense—promote food-based community. Such extended networks take advantage of the communication and distribution infrastructures to allow consumer

and producer (or the producer’s representative) to transact their exchange directly despite their physical separation.

In extended AFNs, the product matters. It would make no sense, practically or environmentally, for an extended network to deal in a product such as lettuce. The best products for extended networks have no locally produced alternatives, are not rapidly perishable, have a high value, and can be shipped easily. Examples include chocolate, spices, and coffee.

Coffee is the prime example of such a product. It is the second most valuable commodity traded globally after oil. It is grown in one part of the world, and primarily consumed in another, distant from the site of production. This distance has allowed the coffee trade to develop into of one of the most exploitative food chains known, with several transnational corporations controlling the roasting, sale, and distribution of the coffee produced by more than 25 million mostly small-scale growers. The early years of the past decade saw coffee prices paid to the farmer reach their lowest levels in history, while prices paid by consumers climbed higher. Exploitation is occurring on both ends of the food chain (Méndez et al. 2006).

**328** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

Two types of extended networks have developed around the goal of providing coffee to consumers in developed countries without contributing to the exploitation of coffee growers in developing countries. In one type, the consumer purchases coffee directly from a cooperative of growers, with the transaction facilitated by a nonprofit organization. An example is provided by the coffee subscription program employed by the Community Agroecology Network (CAN).

In the second type of extended network, traditional retail channels are used, but links are eliminated from the distribution chain, and growers are guaranteed a much higher rate of return than they would get selling their coffee in the mainstream commodity market. An example is the range of different certification programs for organic and fairly traded labels of coffee for sale in many US food stores and online.

Both types of networks can provide consumers with knowledge about the circumstances of the production and distribution of the product and how it contrasts with that of the global food system. CAN, for example, sends subscribers a regular newsletter with information about the growers, their community, and their cooperative and news about the global coffee economy and development projects in the communities that are supported by the choice to buy their coffee. In this way, consumers are educated about the importance of their choices, and are connected with the growers, their families, and their community. In addition to providing growers with a decent wage, AFNs focused on the coffee trade empower growers to use sustainable, low-external-input practices, such as growing coffee plants under the shade of the modified rainforest canopy.

**CASE STUDY: COMMUNITY AGROECOLOGY NETWORK**

The Community Agroecology Network (CAN) directly links farm communities in Central America and Mexico with educators, students, and consumers in North America. By reducing the links in the coffee supply chain to the minimum, CAN is able to provide the farmers who grow the coffee with a much higher rate of return than they could get in the conventional coffee market. This fairer economic return supports farmers’ efforts to grow their coffee using more ecologically benign methods, and it promotes sustainable livelihoods and economic development in the producer communities. In addition, CAN collaborates with Latin American partner organizations to create alternative local markets for farmers so the farm families can diversify what they grow and have income year round (Figure 25.9).

CAN originated in 2002 in discussions among six researchers who had more than 65 collective years of experience working with communities and farmer groups in Latin America. Concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the deepening coffee crisis, they explored ways of supporting the coffee-growing communities where they had developed long-term relationships. Today CAN collaborates on projects in eight regions of Mesoamerica with a goal of creating “a global economy where people, healthy food systems, and the environment come first.” The name Community Agroecology Network was chosen because each word describes an important feature of the organization and its mission:

**FIGURE 25.9** **Youth leaders participate in a workshop linking nutrition and local food as part of a collaboration between** **CAN and the Augusto Cesar Sandino Union of Cooperatives in San Ramon, Matagalpa, Nicaragua.** Together they work with their communities to develop local markets for healthy, locally produced foods.

Community and Culture in the Remaking of the Food System **329**

**• Community.** The organization strives to improve the social and economic health of the producer communi ties in regions where CAN has affiliated researchers working long term. CAN partners with farmers and their families, farmer cooperatives, women’s organizations, nonprofit organizations, and universities to help them implement their vision of integrating sustainable livelihoods and conservation practices. In the United States, CAN works with universities, alternative trade organizations, and coffee roasters to build a membership network linking people interested in more conscientious consumption and direct connections with Latin American farming communities.

**• Agroecology.** Through research and education, CAN promotes an agroecologically based approach to growing

coffee as well as food for the farm family’s own use and for sale at local markets. Farmers in the producer communities can apply agroecological principles that protect watersheds, soils, biodiversity, and the health of their communities. A direct link is established between an improved economic return and protection of environmental resources, while providing food security and sovereignty for their communities.

**• Network.** CAN works to form networks and alliances among university students and youth leaders, researchers,

and consumers, and within producer communities, among different producer communities, and between consumers and producers. Local networks in the producer communities are based on face-to-face interaction. The broader network established among consumers and producers relies on new media for communication as well as educational opportunities for developing direct intercultural relationships. Through this latter network, the coffee drinker gains an understanding of the individuals and the ecosystems that produce his or her coffee, and farmers learn about the people drinking their coffee. Together they can forge relationships of mutual concern and commitment to sustainability.

CAN is part of a growing movement that is “thinking locally and acting globally” by creating awareness internationally between producers in Latin America and consumers in the United States and bringing them together in AFNs through cups of coffee, intercultural exchanges, and diversifying local food production.

**Promoting Local Food**

Farmers’ markets and CSA form the basis of an alternative

local food system, but they are not likely to replace the traditional distribution and retail system. For this reason, it is important to change this system from within and have it concentrate as much as possible on local food. In any particular agricultural bioregion, many food retailers, restaurant owners, and managers of institutions serving food may be open to purchasing more of their food from local farmers, dairies, breweries, wineries, and other producers. In doing so, they may be able to reduce costs, increase their customer base, and stimulate the local economy. A small but growing number of restaurants and retailers in the United States and Europe have demonstrated the economic viability of serving or selling food that is almost entirely local in origin.

A coordinated campaign promoting local food can gain the support of chambers of commerce, business organizations, merchant’s associations, farm bureaus, and the like. It can consist of any of the following elements:

- Farmers form cooperative arrangements for creat ing a regional identity in stores or markets, possibly expanding the wine-based French concept of _terroir_ to food in general.

- Local stores or restaurants offer products that reflect

farmer practice or regional production, communicating the uniqueness or special focus of local production systems.

- Local producers and the regional food identity are

promoted at special events such as fairs and farmers’ markets.

- A common local-identity label is developed for

local food products, to help inform consumer choice and promote the local food identity at the same time.

- The produce at food stores and supermarkets is

labeled with its origin, whether it is local or not.

- Thematic tours of local farms and producers are

arranged for both local residents and tourists.

- A community-based, community-funded, and com munity-managed food hub is created that integrates all of the aforementioned elements (see The Food Commons section).

**Facilitating Informed Consumer Choice**

The face-to-face contact between consumers and farmers

at farm stands and farmers’ markets is an ideal occasion

for sharing of understanding, farming practices, consumer desires, mutual needs and beliefs, and so on. In AFNs without opportunities for one-on-one communication, the major issue—in terms of democratic flow of information—is consumer education. The consumer needs to have available the

information that will allow him or her to make informed

choices. This is equally important outside of AFNs, where it helps to challenge the abuses of the industrial food system and the alienation of the consumer.

**330** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

of the larger food system—away from commodification of food, input intensification, top-down technology-dependent solutions and the like and toward sustainability—it is helpful to have a theoretical framework for understanding how “systems” function in society, whether they are big, powerful, and abstract like the industrial food system or more down to earth like AFNs.

**FIGURE 25.10** **Fairly traded chocolate on a market shelf.** The fair-trade certification tells consumers that the farmers who grew the cacao received fair compensation for their labor. (Photo courtesy of Eric Engles.)

Various means of facilitating informed consumer choice have been developed by consumer groups, organizations of farmers, extended alternative networks, and governments. In a bioregional context, labels of origin can help consumers distinguish local from nonlocal food and become more aware of the difference. In the global food market, certification labels have become an important means of educating consumers. The US government’s certified organic label, and the fairly traded certification mentioned earlier are two examples. The simple existence of such labels raises consciousness of the fact that consumer choices matter (Figure 25.10).

**BUILDING THE FOUNDATION FOR CHANGE**

This chapter has demonstrated that the culture surrounding agriculture and food matters a great deal when it comes to moving the food system in a more sustainable direction. When people are conscious enough about the effects of their food choices to call themselves food citizens instead of con sumers, when opportunities exist for people to interact more directly with those who grow their food, when farmers seeking to grow food more sustainably are supported in their efforts, and when there is a basis for communities to care deeply about how land is used, we are building a strong foundation for transforming the food system and making it more sustainable and more just.

It is important to recognize, however, that this foundation, however vital it may seem to those participating in it, is only part of the story. There is still the corporate-dominated food system described in the previous chapter, growing in strength as it expands into agricultural communities in every corner of the earth, supported by an economic system that even those who advocate for sustainability buy in to without always being conscious of it. To have some idea of how a nascent alternative food system might change the course

Recall, as discussed in Chapter 24, the ideological system that has grown up around food and agriculture. This system shapes how the typical consumer behaves in relation to food, limits the scope of what he or she understands about how food comes to be, and distracts consumer’s attention away from the transfer of wealth from land and workers to corporations that is the basis of food-system dynamics. This ally of corporate dominance can be understood as creating the “isolated consumer” discussed in this chapter and driving the increasing separation between consumers and farmers. By keeping food nonpolitical and making people into mere consumers of food, food-system ideology serves the ends of agribusiness, shaping the commodified culture that this chapter has identified as one of the strongest barriers to sustainability. To generalize this relationship, the global food system can be understood as having two complementary parts—an _economic_ structure of private ownership, capital accumulation, and industrial production practices, and a _cultural_ system of values, perspectives, ideas, psychologies, and motivations. Both parts are necessary for the existence of the whole, and each works to reinforce the other.

In this context, it is possible to see farmers’ markets, CSAs, food hubs, farm stores, local food restaurants, and

other elements of AFNs as the economic facets of an alter native food system and the communities, relationships, and expanded consciousness that support them and develop from them as the cultural facets. The two facets have a mutually reinforcing relationship just like the two parts of the industrial food system. If food-system change consists of the alternative food system expanding and displacing the industrial one, then it is clear that the cultural and economic facets of the alternative system must be considered in tandem, with a focus on how each can reinforce and help grow the other. This can help build the “foundation for change” referred to in the title of this section.

Building the foundation for change in the form of sustainable diets and AFNs is one challenge in promoting food-system transformation; the other, more significant, one is using this foundation to challenge the considerable power of the industrial food system and its strong economic and cultural hold on people all over the world. Because of this power, the scale of changes needed in our food system is daunting. A great deal of change has occurred since Rich Merrill’s _Radical Agriculture_ appeared in 1976, to be sure. Many of the ecological concepts and approaches to farming that he proposed in his chapter “Toward a Self-Sustaining Agriculture” appear in this textbook, and are being implemented broadly by farmers and researchers alike. But most of this change has been—following the distinctions made in Chapter 22—at the

Community and Culture in the Remaking of the Food System **331**

**CASE STUDY: THE FOOD COMMONS**

You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.

**Buckminster Fuller**

Those seeking to create and develop AFNs—farmers, would-be farmers, local food entrepreneurs, and consumers—face many obstacles in realizing their objectives. Because they are outside of the mainstream food system, they typically lack adequate financial resources, suitable land and infrastructure, business supports, training opportunities, and the like. The Food Commons (www.thefoodcommons.org) is seeking to change this reality by building a model for organizing, financing, and running locally based AFNs.

The Food Commons model has three main parts:

1. A **Food Commons** **Trust** owns and develops the physical assets needed to produce, process, and market local

food products. Its mission is to lease land, buildings, and other facilities to small farms and food businesses at affordable rates so as to create opportunities for those who would otherwise lack the start-up resources. 2. A **Food Commons Financing Arm**, or bank, provides low-interest loans to farmers and small business owners

who want to launch or expand their operations. This component is especially important in communities lacking financial institutions that understand the needs of small-scale food businesses. 3. A **Regional Food Hub** coordinates the complex logistics of meshing together the many components of an

alternative food network. Depending on the unique needs of the region, it may provide basic business services, marketing expertise, technical assistance, vocational training, and other services. It also does educational and outreach work in the community, informing consumers and promoting the network’s values of shared prosperity and food-system sustainability.

The idea is that this three-part model can be replicated in various communities around the United States, creating thriving AFNs where none have existed before and where many residents stand to benefit greatly from greater access to healthy food, fulfilling jobs, and entrepreneurial opportunities.

The cities of Fresno, CA, Los Angeles, CA, and Atlanta, GA have prototype FCs in development. In all of these locations, many of the resources needed to establish the trust and the hub are already in the hands of the municipal governments. Abandoned or repossessed urban and urban fringe lands, buildings, factories, stores, and processing facilities are being mobilized to form the basic infrastructure for producing, processing, and aggregating food, distributing food to the community, and linking local producers and processers to the network of eaters throughout the community. The City Council of Fresno has come out in support of the FC in their city, and is working closely with the FC Board to link local growers, processors, distributors, and consumers in a new alternative food network. The challenges of putting together the human and financial resources needed to launch such an enterprise are formidable, but the vision of the local foodshed provides a framework within which this model can unfold.

Advocates of this new foodshed structure also have the goal of connecting regional food networks to each other in a cooperative national federation that coordinates exchanges of information and appropriate trade relationships. Although the Food Commons organization is very clear that its goal is to build an alternative to the industrial food system, not to replace it, the network of regional alternative systems can be seen as a tentative and nascent form of the kind of sustainable food system that may someday replace the homogenized, one-size-fits-all global food system that we have today. In other words, by establishing strong AFNs at Level 4 in the conversion process, as the Food Commons intends to do, we may prepare the ground for the broader transformation to Level 5.

second and third levels of the transition process, and is too restricted to the farm and the farmer. Meanwhile, the separation between the eater and the farmer continues to grow, agriculture becomes more capital intensive, consolidation puts it under the control of fewer people, and the injustices remain. To reach the fourth and fifth levels in the transition process, more radical change—involving the entire food system—is required. It is with this focus that we move into the final chapter of the book.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. When you go to your local supermarket, how much

information is available on who grew the food, how it was grown, and how far away it originated? 2. What are the cultural differences in food prefer ences around the world, and how are these being changed by advertising and the Internet? 3. Food quality is a complex subject. What are some of

the components of food quality that extend beyond

**332** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

nutritional aspects and incorporate more of the components of food-system sustainability? 4. What part of the food that you eat every day could

you grow yourself? 5. How many farmers’ markets are there in your

community? 6. How many farmers do you know? 7. If you were to change your diet in order to reflect

the “culture of sustainability,” what would you add or remove from what you eat now? 8. Why is the labeling of food that contains GMOs

only part of the solution?
