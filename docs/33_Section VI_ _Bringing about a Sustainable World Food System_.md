## _Section VI_ _Bringing about a Sustainable World Food System_

Broadly considered, the farm-scale conversion process discussed in detail in Section V is the necessary foundation of
the much larger _conversion_ that must occur for the world
food system to become sustainable. Venturing beyond farms,
we encounter economic systems of varying scales, political
institutions, values and beliefs, patterns of behavior, social
structures, and the like. Although these aspects of human
society are all outside the traditional purview of agronomy
and even of much agroecological consideration, they form
the context within which agroecology must operate if it hopes
to move the food system toward sustainability. In terms of the
levels of conversion described in Chapter 22, they make up
the territory we are concerned with in pushing forward levels
4 and 5 of the conversion process.

This section divides this very large subject into three
parts. Chapter 24, Agriculture, Society, and Agroecology,



uses a political-economic perspective to investigate the economic structures underlying the world food system, understand the beliefs that give these structures legitimacy, and tie
the concept of power to corporate dominance of the food system. Chapter 25, Community and Culture in the Remaking
of the Food System, looks at the ways in which the food
system has increasingly separated the growers of food from
its eaters, showing how sustainability depends on bringing the two back together. Chapter 26, From Sustainable
Agroecosystems to a Sustainable Food System, attempts
to integrate much of what comes before by looking at the
progress that’s been made at all the levels of the conversion
process and considering how we might continue to build
the strength of the emerging alternative food system until it
makes the current system obsolete.
