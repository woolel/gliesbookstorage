## _Section V_ _The Transition to Sustainability_

The appearance of the so-called Brundtland Report (WCED 1987) in the late 1980s marked the emergence of sustainability as an issue of central concern in agriculture, rural development, natural resource use, and indeed every human endeavor. Since that time, a growing community of researchers and practitioners has made significant progress in developing useful systems for implementing and measuring sustainability, particularly in agriculture.

Although it has effectively lead the effort, the scientific community must still develop a much better understanding of what sustainability actually entails, so that the agenda for change is clear and actionable. A new field known as _sustain-_ _ability science_ has emerged that may help us meet this challenge (Komiyama and Takeuchi 2006; Kates 2011).

From the perspective of sustainability science, food systems are so complex that many fields of inquiry must come

together in understanding how to push their interdependent components toward more sustainable results. Understanding this complexity—and using it as the basis for change—is the goal of the remaining chapters of this text.

In this section, we begin the exploration of the sustainability challenge at a practical, farm-level scale. In Chapter 22, Converting to Ecologically Based Management, we examine the issues surrounding farmers’ efforts to convert to more sustainable practices. This down-to-earth process is one of the necessary foundations for the broader and deeper _conver-_ _sion_ of the entire food system that is the focus on Section VI. Then, in Chapter 23, Indicators of Sustainability, we explore what it means to actually measure progress towards sustainable function, with the focus again at the practical level of the individual farm.
