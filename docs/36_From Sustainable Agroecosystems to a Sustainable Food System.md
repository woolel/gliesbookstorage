## chapter 26. From Sustainable Agroecosystems to a Sustainable Food System

In the previous chapter, we focused on the need to reconnect the two most important parts of the food system: those who grow the food and those who eat it. As localized alternative food networks spring up around the world and grow in size and influence, the global food system begins to be transformed in the direction of sustainability. But this phenomenon by itself, while an important driver of change, represents only part of what needs to happen. Ultimately what is needed is a paradigm shift—a fundamental revolution in thinking, values, ethics, and belief systems, and in the social and economic organization of human societies. Food-system sustainability will be attained only with a parallel transformation in the way that the human species occupies planet earth.

This scale of change is what was described in Chapter 22 as Level 5 of the conversion process. As described in that chapter, the essence of Level 5 is to “build a new global food system, based on equity, participation, and justice, that is not only sustainable but also helps restore and protect Earth’s life-support systems.”

Some might say that it is too much to ask of agroecology to integrate such a broad social-change agenda into what we do as agroecologists. But as we have argued in several chapters of this text, ecological sustainability cannot be isolated from the broader context in which food systems exist. If agroecology limits its attention to the narrow realm of crop production and is satisfied being an alternative to agronomy (which often operates as the scientific arm of the industrial food system), it drastically constrains its ability to move agriculture and the food system in the direction of sustainability. Encompassing conversion Levels 4 and 5 into the mission of agroecology is a natural extension of the whole-system, long-term, ecologybased approach that is at the heart of the field—and on this extension may hinge the very fate of the planet.

**PROGRESS TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY**

Since the 1990s, there has been a very significant increase in agroecologically based agriculture, which is variously termed organic, biological, or ecological. Between 1999 and 2010 the area of land devoted to certified organic agriculture increased threefold to 37 million hectares. There are

12.1 million hectares of such farmland in Oceania (which includes Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Island nations), 10 million hectares in Europe, and 8.4 million hectares in Latin America. In the United States, sales of certified organic food reached $31.5 billion in 2011.

The conversion to agroecological production, especially in developed countries, has taken place mostly at

Level 2, with some occurring at Level 3, and it has been focused at the farm scale. In developing countries, where the majority of population growth today is concentrated, movements promoting sustainable food production have become increasingly important, in part because farmers in these countries have very limited access to the resources that would allow large-scale input substitution to occur. Agriculture in what is referred to as the “Global South” is often far more labor intensive and occurs on a much smaller

scale than in industrial countries, so it is not surprising that approximately 80% of the 1.6 million certified organic farmers in the world live in the developing world. Further, noncertified agroecologically based agriculture is practiced by millions of indigenous people, peasants, and small family farms involved in subsistence and local market-oriented production in developing countries. Interestingly, most of these small-scale organic farmers have made major steps toward Level 3 redesign of their production systems, and many are making good progress toward linking with consumer groups at Level 4 (Figure 26.1).

As reviewed in the previous chapter, the increase in consumer demand for and interest in sustainably grown food has driven the recent progress in conversion to Level 4 in many parts of the world. A very strong local food and farming movement has promoted considerable growth in farmers’ markets, various forms of community-supported agriculture, and direct-marketing schemes that link the grower and the eater more closely. In the United States alone, where the first formal CSA appeared in 1985, there are now many thousands of registered CSA schemes. Some of them represent diverse groups of farmers, offer consumers both fresh and processed products, allow online ordering, and provide consumers with descriptions of the farmers, their farming practices, and the elements of sustainability of their operations. The food-system knowledge that has been generated as a result of such relationships has become an important incentive for the initiation of some changes at Level 5. Much similar change taking place in developing countries is aligned with the local food and food sovereignty movements that are gaining strength in many parts of the world.

Despite all of this progress, and the remarkable increase in Level 4 alternative food-system networks, the total percentage of global food production and consumption accounted for by these networks is in the low single digits. Further, the industrial food system has blunted much of the potential impact of these changes by co-opting organic food and even adopting the language of the “slow” and “local” food movements in its advertising. This means that the alternative food opinion is healthy, it is also helpful to have a reference point that’s not so subject to dispute. One such a reference point is provided by the **carrying capacity** of the biosphere. In ecology, carrying capacity is usually defined as the population size that can be supported by an ecosystem without destroying that ecosystem; when dealing with human beings and whole biosphere, however, it is more meaningful to replace “population size” with “the overall ecological impact of the species” because individual human beings’ impacts on the environment can vary so widely.

The ultimate reason why our present food system is unsustainable is that it causes the human species to exceed the carrying capacity of the biosphere. In this broadest of contexts, then, a _sustainable_ food system is one that, in contrast, allows the human species to live within the carrying capacity of the biosphere.

**FIGURE 26.1** **An organic coffee farm in San Ramon,** **Nicaragua.** The farm is diversified beyond coffee for the export market, including fruit trees, shade, firewood, native forest species, and other useful species. Note the contrast with the organic carrot monoculture in Figure 24.9.

system is just that—on the outside of the mainstream, with limited impact in moving the entire food system to Level 5 and bringing about broader change in society.

What needs to be done differently? How much further does the alternative food movement have to go? How can agroecology strengthen the movement? We will begin to answer these questions in the following as we explore in more detail what is needed for food-system sustainability and what sustainable food systems will look like.

**ATTAINING SUSTAINABILITY**

In Chapter 1 we listed some of the “elements of a sustainable food system” as a way of putting the unsustainable practices of industrial agriculture into sharper contrast. Now that we’ve explored the agroecological foundations of sustainability, along with some aspects of the social systems within which the food system exists, we can revisit the question “what would a sustainable food system look like?” and formulate answers with fuller meaning. This look at what sustainability entails will provide a clearer vision of the goals we want to achieve for food systems and highlight the barriers and challenges we face in reaching those goals.

Agroecologists and others working to build a sustainable food system will inevitably disagree about what constitutes sustainability; they will have different ideas about the most ideal forms for organizing sustainable food production and distribution; and they will differ on how best to accelerate the transformation to sustainable future. These differences

come about because of the expected diversity in values, foundational assumptions, and worldviews that exist even among those who share basic goals. Although this diversity of

The concept of the **ecological footprint**, developed in 1990 by Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees at the University of British Columbia, has become a widely recognized means of measuring the ecological demands that an individual, a city, a region, or a country—or all of humanity—places on the biosphere. It entails making estimates of the resource use, energy use, and pollution that goes along with everything human beings do in the course of living. These estimates are rough, of course, but there is broad consensus that human society as a whole is currently impacting the biosphere at a level clearly exceeding its carrying capacity. The current estimate is that the human species is impacting the biosphere at a level that would require 1.5 earths in order to be sustainable (Global Footprint Network 2014). By 2030, humanity is expected to reach the point where it is using the equivalent of _two whole earths_ to support itself—and that projection is based on conservative estimates of increasing impacts.

Every day that human society and its food system exceed the earth’s carrying capacity, our impacts undermine the ability of the biosphere to support us. We are borrowing from the earth’s ecological bank account, which is not infinite. At some point, the ecological systems that support life on the planet—allow food to be grown, recycle our wastes, provide us with water, energy, fiber, and raw materials—will begin to break down. Our debt will come due. The most basic

benchmark for sustainability, then, is an overall ecological footprint for humanity that does not exceed the carrying capacity—or what is sometimes called the _biocapacity_ —of the earth. Based on this benchmark, we must lower our ecological footprint by at least 33%—or more, if it rises beyond 1.5 earths in the meantime.

Although humanity’s ecological impact comes from every form of resource use and every kind of waste emission, agriculture contributes to it the most. Agriculture uses more water and more land than any other human activity, emits a large proportion of total greenhouse gas emissions, and releases large amounts of ecosystem-damaging substances such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment. Add to this the ecological impacts of the ways we process, distribute, and consume food, and it becomes clear that the foodrelated portion of a person’s or city’s or country’s ecological

footprint—its “foodprint”—is proportional to its total ecological footprint.

So if humanity’s ecological footprint is at present about 50% greater than what is sustainable, then so is our foodprint. The previous chapters have already expressed what is entailed in responding to this basic threat to our existence— fundamental changes in how food is produced along with dramatic reductions in the impacts of consumption—but now we have a rough quantification of the goal: a reduction of 33% in the ecological impacts of the food system.

To reduce the total foodprint of the human species by at least a third, the average per-person foodprint must be reduced by an equal amount. That’s simple math. Since the foodprints of people around the world vary considerably, this means that those with the largest foodprints must reduce their ecological impacts by a much larger proportion than those with smaller foodprints. Indeed, from an ethical standpoint, those with the smallest foodprints must be allowed to _increase_ them to reach at least minimal levels of food security (Figure 26.2).

It will be impossible, of course, for all human beings to have equally low foodprints, but the necessary level of reduction cannot be achieved unless the current broad range is dramatically narrowed. Measures of ecological footprints for different countries, which roughly correspond to their foodprints, provide some indication of how far those in affluent countries would have to go to bring their foodprints reasonably close to what can be sustained by the earth’s biocapacity. The average ecological footprint of a person living in the United States, for example, is estimated to be well over _four_ _times_ the sustainable level for the world, whereas the average person in Ghana, Armenia, or Chad has an impact that’s approximately equal to average global biocapacity (Global Footprint Network 2014).

It’s important to recognize that this examination of ecological footprints provides an _ecological_ argument for greater

equality. The extreme inequality that exists today in access to food resources, both between countries and within them, is incompatible with the goal of sustainability. Greater equity in relation to food—one of the basic principles of food sustainability that this text has put forward—is therefore an ecological imperative in addition to being an ethical necessity.

What kind of food system will allow humanity to reduce its overall ecological impact, and its foodprint, by 33% or more? This is the question that must guide any vision of future sustainability for agriculture and the larger food system. When a reference point such as this is applied to the problem, the depth and extent of the changes that will be needed become clearer. It will not be sufficient to merely stem the anticipated increases in human impact on the biosphere—we much achieve significant _reductions_ in that impact, even as the number of people contributing to that impact continues to grow. Just modifying business-as-usual approaches is not going to work, because it is business as usual that’s the cause of the problem.

Given this reality, we can develop a few basic premises on which to base a vision of a sustainable food system:

**Everything is on the table.** The changes that are required are so fundamental that no culture, human institution, or social structure can remain off-limits to sustainability-based transformation. This includes systems of governance and political organization, economies, and institutions that shape and caretake values and ethics.

**Sustainability in the food system cannot be isolated** **from overall sustainability.** How we feed ourselves is so basic to our existence that it can’t be separated from the other things we do. Further, the biosphere doesn’t distinguish between food-related impacts and those from other human activities.

**Greater equality is paramount.** As noted earlier, inequality—in wealth, power, consumption, and access to food—is antithetical to sustainability.

**We have to kick our addiction to growth.** The need for growth that’s at the core of all the world’s economic systems is fundamentally incompatible with reducing humanity’s ecological footprint. Growth is driven by consumption, and consumption is what generates the ecological impacts that we need to reduce.

With these premises in mind, we can apply the filter of an agroecological worldview and propose that a sustainable food system must display the following features:

- The system for organizing trade and productive

activity in which the food system is embedded (the economic system) is based on the principles of equal exchange, fairness, and access. It does not need growth or capital accumulation to function, and it has no place for greed.

- The food system is organized as a commons, in

which there is an even and relatively equal distribution of the benefits and costs of food production

**338** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

among the entire community, from the seed and soil to the table and back again. The lure of privatized profit is replaced by the desire to promote the public good.

- Both the food system and the larger society support,

and in fact demand, a full, transparent, and equitable accounting of all ecological costs. The negative consequences of productive and consumptive behavior are taken into account, borne equally, and mitigated so they are not absorbed by the environment or by less-powerful populations.

- The geography of the food system is designed to

allow people to live much closer to where their food is grown, processed, and prepared. Localness, freshness, access, and direct relationships between growers and eaters are valued elements.

- Industrial cultural energy use in agriculture is

replaced by biological cultural energy, particularly its human form. The work people do in producing food is valued and rewarded appropriately and fairly. A much greater proportion of the population participates directly in food production.

- Diets are based on real nutritional needs and sup port health and well-being rather than corporate profit margins. Empty-calorie foods are unknown, and the foods with the highest ecological costs— particularly those derived from animals—are treated as luxuries to be eaten sparingly. The meat that is consumed is produced in integrated crop– livestock systems or sustainably managed grazing

or pasture systems.

- It is universally recognized that every individual

has, alone or in community with others, the right to sufficient and culturally acceptable food that is produced and consumed sustainably.

- Agricultural production is handled predominantly

by diverse, small-holder farms integrated into a multifunctional landscape that provides both food and environmental services. Large-scale monocultures dependent on external inputs and focused on yield maximization have disappeared.

- The food system is carbon neutral: production sys tems mitigate climate change by returning carbon to the soil and sequestering it in living biomass.

- Rural communities are healthy and dynamic and

meet their own needs while providing food and environmental services for others. They are well integrated with regional centers of denser population.

- Communities at the grassroots level—including

women, children, seniors, and the poor—are empowered to direct and govern their own affairs, rather than having decisions made for them by economic and political powers at the top.

This vision of food-system sustainability constitutes a possible goal, or end point, of the transition to Level 5. There is no guarantee that realizing all these features will result

**FIGURE 26.3** **A small-scale, pasture-raised meat chicken** **operation on the central coast of California.** Organic feed is supplemented by insects, seeds, and grass, the animals are raised under relatively stress-free conditions, and the plot can be used for crop production after the animals are moved. Systems such as this are compatible with many of the fundamental features of the sustainable food system of the future.

in humanity limiting its ecological impact to the carrying capacity of the biosphere, but creating a food system with these features will go a long way toward insuring the future of the planet and our species.

**DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD**

As noted earlier, tremendous progress has been made in moving toward the vision outlined in the previous discussion. It is significant that many of the elements of this vision will not sound particularly far-fetched to many readers, and that many of them are already being realized at a small and local scale around the world. We must recognize, however, that the barriers to change are enormous and that there are many important factors largely beyond our control that will constrain our choices and raise the bar for sustainability.

**F** **acing** **the** **E** **cological** **and** **D** **emographic** **R** **ealities**

Humans have transformed the face of the earth with agriculture, the harvest of trees for building materials and fuel and fiber, mining, urban development, and construction of transportation and energy infrastructure. We have increased the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to levels unseen in hundreds of thousands of years. We have allowed aggressive weeds, invertebrates, disease organisms, and other pests to spread widely beyond former barriers, disrupting ecosystems everywhere. We have overfished the oceans, destroying fisheries that once provided many with a large proportion of their food. We have leaked, dumped, and poured tremendous quantities of toxic and environmentally disruptive substances into the water, air, and soil, making many of them virtually ubiquitous. The cumulative effect of all this human impact is

From Sustainable Agroecosystems to a Sustainable Food System **339**

environmental change on a geologic scale. In the scant period of a few thousand years, the human species has become a planet-changing force, leading many scientists to argue that we have entered a new geologic age, which they call the **Anthropocene** .

The defining aspect of the Anthropocene is that human activity has become a major driver of biosphere change. The frightening part is that we have only a limited grasp of the new dynamics that we have set in motion. We do know, however, that we have unleashed changes that are going to move in a particular direction for the foreseeable future no matter what we do. A major driver of these changes is the accumulation of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will warm the planet and affect climates globally for centuries even if we drastically reduce the burning of fossil fuels tomorrow.

Some of the most consequential of the changes in the biosphere wrought by human activity are listed below. We no longer have the ability to prevent these changes from occurring; we have some control, however, over the magnitude of each change and its rate of progression.

- Supplies of freshwater—for both agriculture and

general human use—will diminish in most parts of the world, catastrophically so in some places. This is a result of overdrafting of underground aquifers, pollution of many surface waters and aquifers, a general reduction in the amount of snow falling in the world’s mountain ranges, and a reduction in rainfall in some arid and semiarid locations.

- Biodiversity will continue to decline, and rates of

extinction and extirpation may accelerate. Many natural systems have already become more fragile, and the loss of more species will only increase their vulnerability. As these systems lose biodiversity and become more simplified, their ecosystem services are in danger of being lost. The loss of species is irreversible.

- Much agricultural land will be lost to sea level rise,

salinization, drought, and desertification as freshwater resources are stretched thin and the climate

warms.

- Much less protein will be available from wild caught fish because many fisheries will collapse, victims of overfishing and vast ecological changes brought about by the acidification and warming of the oceans.

- Exploitable supplies of critical food-system re

sources, such as phosphorus, will diminish, and the resulting increases in their price and availability will combine to limit access to fewer and fewer of

those who need them.

- Climate change will make agriculture an increas ingly risky enterprise in many parts of the world, increasing the rate of crop failures, reducing yields, and possibly causing the abandonment of some agricultural land.

The combined effects of these essentially irreversible trends are sobering. At a time when we are increasing humanity’s overall ecological footprint, these changes are reducing the biosphere’s biocapacity, further widening the gap between our footprint and the earth’s ability to absorb it. And the wider the gap gets, the more biocapacity is reduced.

And then there’s the problem of population growth. Based on projections for the global human population put forward by the United Nations, the number of people on the earth will rise from close to seven billion in 2010 to just over nine billion by 2050 (United Nations 2010). Most of this rise will probably occur in the developing world. In general, two billion more people means a significant increase in the ecological footprint of the human species, which greatly complicates the goal of reducing that footprint. Not only does population increase continually reset the potential footprint at a higher level, but it also means that the required per-capita reduction increases substantially.

A further problem is that population growth in developing countries is combined with rising incomes, which means an increasing demand for more processed, animal-derived, and higher-value foods—precisely those with the highest ecological impacts. So as the number of human beings in the world increases, so too does the per-capita impact of each one.

If the previous discussion seems to point to a clouded future, consider what our world will look like if we continue on

the current food-system trajectory, directed by the needs of industrial agriculture and a growth-dependent economy. As described in detail in Chapter 1, the practices of industrial agriculture are characterized most centrally by high ecological impacts: emission of large amounts of greenhouse gases, pollution of the environment by animal manures and agricultural chemicals, soil loss, use of large volumes of freshwater for irrigation, erosion of agrobiodiversity, reduction and degradation of natural systems and loss of their ecosystem services, and so on. There is no doubt that humanity’s overall ecological footprint will continue to broaden as long as industrial agriculture remains dominant. Further, the capitalist economic system in which industrial agriculture operates insures that there will be continuing pressure on the consumption side of the food system to increase per-capita foodprints. Growth and capital accumulation, which drive the system, come from increases in consumption, so we can be assured that the system and its many allies will push more consumption.

It is difficult to predict the shorter-term consequences of continuing on the trajectory on which industrial agriculture is taking us. While it is clear that the ecological impacts of the current food system, if not curtailed significantly, will eventually cause catastrophic collapse of the natural systems that are the foundation of agricultural productivity, we have very little idea how long it will take before that collapse begins to

**340** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

requires an even a stronger emphasis on the yield-increasing practices and approaches of industrial agriculture (Conway 2012). Until this viewpoint is discredited, industrial agriculture will have the justification it needs to continue its dominance in the food system.

The absence of an impending crisis should not lull us into complacency, however. Combined with the irreversible changes that humans have already unleashed on the biosphere, continuing on the trajectory of industrial agriculture is sure to lead to calamity. It’s only a matter of time. If we allow it to happen, a particularly unwelcome kind of solution may be forced on us: widespread famine, war, and violence leading to rapid depopulation.

**FIGURE 26.4** **A monoculture oil palm plantation near Golfito,** **Costa Rica.** Cropland is being displaced to feed the demand for biofuels. This is one of the ways that industrial agriculture expands the ecological footprint of the food system.

occur, how quickly it will ramify through the biosphere, and just how catastrophic it will be.

There are many reasons, however, to believe that continuing on the current path will not precipitate any period of extreme crisis in the near term, perhaps not for decades. As noted in the chapter _Genetic Resources in Agroecosystems_ (Chapter 15), industrial agriculture shows an ability to mitigate the short-term consequences of its practices: the negative effects of a particular technology are temporarily “corrected” with a new technology, allowing the cycle to continue. For its part, the biosphere seems to be remarkably resilient, able to continue functioning in a relatively normal way even as its foundations are severely weakened. And human societies seem fairly resilient as well, showing an ability to defuse protests by the poor and hungry, to weather short-term food crises and droughts, and to respond to pressures with reforms that maintain their stability.

In the absence of any actual extreme crisis, supporters of industrial agriculture are likely to continue to be successful in using the _threat_ of crisis to justify the use of any and all technological fixes, including increased use of fertilizers, genetically modified seeds, and a focus on market and biofuel crops. As we noted in Chapter 24, the dominant narrative is that feeding the growing number of people in the world

Nobody wants this grim picture of the future to become a reality. But the forces in control of our food systems don’t see that they are helping to hasten the arrival of such a future.

The sooner we reverse course in our food systems, the better. With every day that passes, the problems and impacts previously described only worsen. The longer we wait to put the multiple levels of conversion fully into motion, the less control we have over our fate.

**HOPE AND ACTION FOR CHANGE**

This text has assumed throughout that fundamental change in the food system is both necessary and possible. It has advocated that the field of agroecology adopt an active social-change orientation, based on the assumption that realizing the goal of a more just and more equitable food system is realistic. These assumptions persist even in the face of the daunting challenges and realities just discussed.

One reason for having confidence in our ability to create a sustainable food system is the success experienced in putting into practice some of the basic principles underlying agroecology’s commitment to farmer collaboration and social change. Through the process of participatory action research (PAR), for example, agroecologists around the world have undertaken food-system research and development projects that link research, participation, and action for food system change in a reflective and iterative process, creating an effective alternative to the current top-down approach of research and extension (see the Special Topic feature Participatory Action Research).

**SPECIAL TOPIC: PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH**

Inherently interdisciplinary, agroecology is most effective when it links the multiple players from all of the resource sectors in the food system through collaborative research and education (Uphoff 2002; Guzmán-Casado and AlonsoMielgo 2008; Snapp and Pound 2008). When this collaborative approach is linked with action for change, a process develops that has been called PAR. PAR is an iterative, ongoing process of reflection, action, and research that seeks to provide a place for all voices in the food system to be heard, especially those that have been traditionally excluded from the research and development process—small farmers, consumers, farm laborers, and women and children. These marginalized populations are engaged in the process not just through consultation, but also through direct participation (Eksvärd et al. 2009).

From Sustainable Agroecosystems to a Sustainable Food System **341**

Participative collaboration begins early in a PAR or education project. Partners interact through a mutual dialogue to arrive at a common agreement that meets most of the partners’ needs, abilities, and interests. This dialogue allows for the development of a shared understanding of the project’s goals, challenges, and benefits. But the dialogue is also linked to action and practice; for farmers, this may mean major changes in the design and management of their farms. For food consumers, it may mean major changes in purchasing patterns, food choices, and the understanding of how food gets from the farm to the table. Each time an action for change is taken, things can shift, and the long-term relationship that partners have developed allows for follow-up exchange, new activities, and future change.

Agroecological principles—whether they are explicitly recognized as such or not—are being applied everyday on small- and medium-scale farms that are purposely growing food outside the system of industrial agriculture. These operations provide a fertile ground for future change in both farm-level practices and the socioeconomic context in which they exist. By linking these forms of practice with agroecological science through participatory relationships, a very _practical_ kind of agroecology emerges. A feedback between practice and science is developed, where farmers help define the problems that need to be solved, test the solutions, and experiment with the innovative alternatives that must replace the industrial model.

An example of how PAR can integrate farmer knowledge into research and outreach exists in the collaborative work of an interdisciplinary group of graduate students and professors at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Working with NGO researchers from multiple disciplines on a participatory project involving coffee communities in Mexico and Central America, this group conducts research resulting in academic publications (e.g., Bacon et al. 2005) and helps organize direct actions in the communities (Figure 26.5). Another example of PAR comes from Andalusia, Spain, where researchers, professors, and extensionists associated with the graduate program in agroecology of the Institute of Sociology and Campesino Studies ( _ISEC_ in Spanish) at the University of Cordoba have developed a focus on the needs of small farmers, cooperatives, and consumers in southern Spain (Sevilla-Guzmán 2006; Cuellar-Padilla and Calle-Callado 2011). Other similar relationships between farming communities and agroecologists have promoted a strong agroecology component in social movements throughout Latin America, such as the Landless Peasant Movement in Brazil ( _MST_ in Portuguese) and La Via Campesina (Altieri and Toledo 2011).

In many ways, PAR mirrors the basic principles underlying the agroecological approach. The emphasis on diversity and whole systems in agroecology is reflected in the effort to bring together diverse voices and knowledge systems and to democratize research, education, and social-change processes. The long-term time perspective that is so important in the agroecological approach is reflected in PAR’s emphasis on forming long-term relationships and in the cyclical/iterative nature of the PAR process.

An even more important reason for believing that a sustainable food system is within reach is the potential power of the model of grassroots change embodied in Levels 4 and 5 of the conversion process. Progress at Levels 1–3 of the conversion process expands the basis for Level 4 alternative food networks. Alternative food networks grow in number and increase their strength and visibility, giving more and more consumers the opportunity to participate in them. More and more people thus have the experience of buying healthy food directly from the person who grows it. By connecting in this way, buyers develop relationships with growers, learn of the ecological soundness of the farming practices that are used, and become aware of how the industrial food system puts profits ahead of people and the environment yet doesn’t have to pay the costs of ecological degradation or social injustice. These experiences provide the motivation to participate in changing the current system by supporting sustainable alternatives, and they form the expanding basis for change at Level 5, where basic belief, value, and ethical systems change. The expanding awareness that’s part of this process then extends to other facets of environmental and social relationships, bringing about a paradigm shift focused on reducing our ecological footprint, recognizing limits to growth, and living sustainably.

In this model, change at any one level makes possible change at the next level, which feeds back to support further change at the first level, which in turn supports more change at the next level. The overall effect, therefore, can be powerfully synergistic. We are already seeing this synergism in the rapid expansion and replication of alternative food networks around the world. As these alternatives to

the industrial food system increase in number, they begin to link together, forming networks of networks with even greater influence over the actions and beliefs of consumers and eaters around the world. At some point, the alternative system will make the industrial, corporate-controlled food system obsolete. People will become more fully aware of the harms caused by the industrial food system and abandon it, choosing to participate instead in the alternative system that’s been growing up around them and has already proven to support a more equitable, just, and sustainable society. In this way, the kind of action for change recommended in this text could propel a rapidly unfolding, crisis-free transition to sustainability.

The ways in which the levels of conversion work together to transform the food system are outlined in Table 26.1.

We acknowledge that this model of change could be based on overly optimistic assumptions. We are not recommending that readers adopt it as an article of faith. The whole-system approach at the heart of agroecology argues for serious consideration of the challenges discussed earlier in this chapter. Climate change and the power of the industrial food paradigm could lead readers to conclude that humanity is most likely headed toward ecological Armageddon, that sustainability in any form is still very far off in the future, or that humanity will achieve a sustainable presence on the planet only after prolonged and intense crisis. These are all reasonable conclusions based on our

present state of knowledge.

But beliefs about the future should not control what we

do in the present. If they do, the “prophecy” becomes selffulfilling. So, even if it seems that a sustainable food system

is not in the offing, it’s still essential to behave _as if it is_ and to work toward that goal. This stance was expressed in terms of hope by Vaclav Havel: “Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well but the certainty that something makes sense regardless of how it turns out.”

Beyond the philosophical realm, there are important practical reasons for agroecologists and others who support the goal of sustainability to build alternative food systems, to increase awareness of food-justice issues, and to challenge the ideology supporting industrial agriculture, despite any doubts about what the future may hold:

- Alternative food networks and increased attention

to food-justice issues make a real difference in people’s lives in the present. They create jobs with living wages, make opportunities for entrepreneurial development, strengthen local economies, and provide people with healthy food.

- Any progress made in moving toward sustainabil ity, however limited, is a positive step toward reducing humanity’s ecological footprint and slowing the damage being done to the biosphere.

- If the status quo holds for a long time and the transi tion to a fundamentally different, sustainable food system is in fact triggered by crisis, the existence of functioning alternatives may help the transition occur with greater rapidity and less disruption.

If it comes as a surprise to many of us that humanity has been able to wield the power to nearly destroy our seemingly limitless planet, then perhaps we will be equally surprised by our power to heal it and realize the potential inherent in our species’ unique combination of intelligence and compassion. We won’t know until we try.

Agroecological knowledge exists in farming systems around the world. New knowledge is being generated every time a seed is planted. Linking this knowledge to the paradigm shift going on in food systems promotes the social changes that can become a movement for the new alternative food-system paradigm. This movement brings sustainability to the environment upon which we depend, prosperity to the relocalized economies that it fosters, and equity and access to the society of which we are all part of. We each have the responsibility to make the necessary changes. It is hoped that the agroecological vision presented in this book will provide the basis for much of this transformation.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. How does this well-known quote from Margaret

Mead relate to the movement for food-system sustainability? “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.” 2. What are some of the ethical, social, personal, and

faith-based issues that complicate the search for solutions to the “population problem?” 3. What are some of the characteristics of the food

system paradigm shifts going on in your own community? How could you become more involved in them?

4. Small-holder, traditional, indigenous, and local food

systems are often looked to as examples of sustainable agroecosystem alternatives. How do such systems demonstrate the idea of “going forward by going backward?” 5. If you wanted to eat lower on the food chain, how

would you have to change your current eating habits? How might this have positive impacts on how food systems are designed and managed?
