## chapter 24. Agriculture, Society, and Agroecology

In Chapter 1, we described the many serious harms to the environment, to society, and to the foundations of agricultural productivity that are part of the price we pay for the prodigious productivity of the system of industrial agriculture that dominates much of the world today. Among these many harms, industrial agriculture drains ancient aquifers, depletes soils that have been built up over millennia, reduces biodiversity, adds huge volumes of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, damages the natural systems that provide us with critical ecosystem services, and puts the control of food production in the hands of fewer and fewer people.

In the chapters following Chapter 1, this book has built up, layer by layer, the principles, strategies, and methods that constitute an approach to producing food that is very different from that of industrial agriculture. These chapters have all rested on the assumption that industrial agriculture is unsustainable over the long term, has unacceptable costs in the present, and does in fact need to be replaced by systems resting on an agroecological foundation.

Evidence accumulated since the rise of agroecological thinking, practice, and research in the 1980s indicates that this alternative approach to agriculture is indeed far more sustainable than the industrial approach, much less damaging to the planet’s life-support system, and more consistent with efforts to alleviate the misery endured by world’s poorest people (e.g., IAASTD 2009; IFAD 2013). Research also supports the contention that the agroecological approach to agriculture is more than capable of producing enough food to feed the world’s population, not just now but into the foreseeable future (Badgley and Perfecto 2007; Badgley et al. 2007).

Since the ultimate purpose of presenting the foundations of agroecology in this book is to facilitate the transition to a more sustainable world food system, we must now—after focusing on the transition to sustainability in the previous section—turn to examining the actual status of the transition. Considering all that we know about the two systems, and assuming that people would want to choose the option with the brightest future, we might expect the more sustainable methods of the agroecological approach to be gaining ground and slowly replacing those of industrial agriculture. Such a trend is evident on a local basis in developed countries, but overall, globally, the opposite is occurring. Not only are the practices known to be unsustainable not being curtailed or replaced generally, they are being embraced with what seems like increasing enthusiasm. The area of land planted to genetically modified crops is expanding dramatically, as noted in Chapter 15. Small-scale production is declining

around the world instead of growing. Nearly everywhere that it hasn’t already happened, monocultures are replacing diverse polycultures, rather than the other way around. Farmers all over the world are turning to practices that make them more dependent on external inputs, not less. There are encouraging counterexamples in each of these areas, but in these and many other ways, the world food system as a whole is becoming ever more dependent on, and dominated by, the technology-intensive, capital-intensive, industrial-based methods described in Chapter 1 (Figure 24.1).

Why does human society as a whole seem intent on pursuing the path of industrial agriculture, even though it has demonstrably dire consequences in the long run? Posed this question, many people in the agricultural policy arena would give an answer something like this: GMOs, monoculture, large-scale production, and the other facets of industrial agriculture are becoming increasingly dominant because they increase agricultural productivity, and _not_ using them would cause dire consequences in the form of food shortages and hunger. Very simply, they would say, the practices of industrial agriculture allow farmers to grow more food— and growing food is, after all, the whole point of agriculture.

This answer satisfies many, but it shouldn’t satisfy those who have read Chapter 1. First, it doesn’t address the many seriously negative consequences—and threats to future productivity—known to be associated with the practices of industrial agriculture. Second, it doesn’t acknowledge the existence of other, more sustainable means of increasing productivity and ensuring food security.

But recognizing the basic flaws of the “double-downon-industrial-agriculture-to-feed-the-world” argument doesn’t get us any closer to resolving the original quandary. Not only is the world as a whole taking a course in food production that is ultimately self-destructive, but a large number of people think that this is precisely the course the world _should_ be taking. Clearly, something is going on that merits closer examination—and that something, we suggest, is related to beliefs, political commitments, economic interests, and the ways people interpret ideas and facts. To understand these factors, we must take a step back, look beyond agriculture itself, and examine the broader context within which agriculture operates; that is, we must look at markets, economic structures, government policies, politics, the struggles that occur between groups with different levels of power, and the conceptual frameworks people use to understand these things—all of which is included under the rubric of _society_ . In taking this approach, we can begin to see that there are very strong social and economic reasons

economic life. By incorporating these tools into the analytical approach and research agenda of agroecology, we can gain some understanding of why the food system continues on its destructive trajectory; this understanding, in turn, generates the realization that food-system change will not come about if agroecologists are content to merely design sustainable alternative agroecosystems. They must also advocate and work for fundamental change in the entire food ­system—including the beliefs and assumptions that form its social foundation—and work to manifest this change on the ground in partnership with those who actually work the land and consume the food it produces.

**AGRICULTURE, NARROWLY CONCEIVED**

**FIGURE 24.1** **Genetically modified corn growing in large-** **scale monoculture in Iowa.** Unsustainable practices such as genetic engineering and input-intensive monoculture are becoming more widespread, defended by many as necessary for meeting the growing demand for food.

why human societies are moving in a seemingly irrational direction with regard to agriculture and why there is such widespread commitment to continuing in this direction.

We began to explore the relationship between agriculture and society in Chapter 2. In that chapter, we examined agroecosystems as human-managed ecosystems that respond to human needs and goals. Then we explored how, by scaling up the most concrete form of agroecosystem—the crop field or individual farm—we can conceptualize successive agroecosystem levels ranging through the region and the rural–urban landscape to the single, interconnected global food system. By taking into account all the manifestly social activities of producing, distributing, and consuming food, the agroecosystem concept puts agriculture in a social context.

But this is only the beginning of where we need to go, because the relationship between agriculture and society embodied in the agroecosystem concept is mostly formal. That is to say, the concept helps us understand that agriculture and society depend on each other and influence each other, but it doesn’t provide us with the tools we need to examine the content of that interdependence and how it is related to people’s beliefs and assumptions.

The key to acquiring these tools is to move beyond the natural-science framework within which agroecology was originally established and access some of the insights of the social sciences. That’s the core purpose of this chapter. It is grounded in the idea that the ecological concepts on which agroecology is based, while absolutely necessary for comprehending the many nature–society interconnections in the food system, are insufficient for understanding phenomena unique to the social world that ultimately control the sustainability of the food system. In addition to ecological concepts, we also need analytical tools that pay attention to beliefs, values, and assumptions and how they are shaped by—and help to reinforce—the structures of social, political, and

Human beings understand the complex world they inhabit through simpler, more concrete things and relationships that are easier to understand. We take such things as face-to-face interactions, families, and stories of individual struggle and use them as metaphors, analogies, and models that allow us to make sense of hard-to-fathom abstractions like class struc ture, racism, and the national economy. The tangible and the immediate, in other words, offer frameworks on which we can hang more abstract ideas. For example, to understand the enormously complex world of economic activity, we use as a model the one-on-one interaction between an individual

shopkeeper and his or her customers. Through this simple model, we can more easily understand complex phenomena such as supply and demand, even as they apply to nationallevel economies and international trade.

While helpful—and probably even essential—for comprehending the social world, models like this one have important limitations. Idealized and based on what happens at the simplest levels of social organization, their features are never fully parallel to those of social processes operating at the societal level, which have properties (much like ecosystems) that can exist only at those more complex levels. Moreover, these models often contain particular biases that end up shaping our conceptions when they are extended by analogy to higher social levels.

Such is the case with the models humans (in developed countries, at least) use to understand agriculture in its relationship to society. The basic model here is like that of the aforementioned shopkeeper–customer relationship: there’s a farmer who grows food and there are those who come directly to the farmer to buy his or her food. The farmer’s customers have certain needs and desires for food, which are thought of as “demand”, and the farmer has certain amounts and kinds of food, which are conceived of as “supply”. Supply and demand thus interact and affect each other: greater demand for a certain food induces the farmer to grow more of that food.

Extended by analogy to larger scales, this model forms the basis through which people understand the entire foodproducing enterprise we call “agriculture”. It influences the way most people—from food consumers to high-level policy makers—think about agriculture, and thus any issue related

Agriculture, Society, and Agroecology **303**

**FIGURE 24.2** **A conceptual model of the food system.** In addition to vastly oversimplifying the food system, it encourages people to make certain assumptions about how the system works.

to food and food production, including hunger, food distribution, and the production methods used on farms. In this conception, agriculture is like one giant farm, the people who eat food (i.e., all people) are grouped together as “consumers,” and the two are linked by supply and demand, just like the individual farmer and his customer. Demand from the consumer side influences what and how much farmers in the agriculture sphere grow and produce, and this makes up the supply of food—in a region, a nation, or the world as a whole. This model is illustrated in Figure 24.2.

It is easy to see how this model oversimplifies the food system as it was described in Chapter 2. Agriculture is walled off from all of the various physical factors of production: biodiversity, natural system processes and their ecological services, the supply of land and irrigation water, soil and soil quality, inputs like phosphorus and nitrogen, energy sources, climate, and so on. The people who work in the agricultural sector are all placed on an equal footing as “farmers”, ignoring the fact that many are struggling smallholders or landless tenant farmers and others are huge transnational corporations with billions in annual revenue. The eaters of food are

treated as a single monolithic block, erasing the inequalities that leave millions without food security. The huge apparatus that exists between the people who grow food and those who consume it—consisting of processors, brokers, distributors, manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers—is overlooked entirely, as is the large proportion of food that is wasted along the way. The ability of agribusiness interests on the agriculture side to shape consumer demand through advertising and other means is completely left out as well. Perhaps most importantly, food production in this model is reduced to a merely technical problem in a purely economic context: to meet consumers’ demand for food, farmers develop and use the methods that produce the most food for the least cost. Thought of in this way, farming methods are hidden inside the “black box” of agriculture; they are not the concern of anyone outside the agricultural enterprise.

If this simple economic model provides your conceptual framework for understanding agriculture, you are not apt to see much of a problem with the way agriculture operates in the world today. As long as agriculture (the one big farm) is meeting the overall demand for food from the world’s food consumers, everything is OK. If you are aware of problems like hunger, soil erosion, and the polluting effects of agricultural runoff, you are likely to see them as unintended side

effects, as essentially technical problems subject to technical solutions. If there is hunger in the world and the world’s population is growing, that simply means that farmers must grow more food, and the technologies that enable the growing of more food, like GMOs, must therefore be used more extensively.

As the foregoing description suggests, there are many indicators that a particular writer or thinker is working from this model. If a writer says that food is grown by “farmers” (and the writer is not referring specifically to small-scale or family farms), then he or she may be making the erroneous assumption, embedded in the model, that all food production happens in the context of something resembling a family farm. If the writer is concerned primarily about “productivity” or “yield” and is ignoring the ecological and social impacts of industrial production methods, then the oversimple economic model may be clouding the writer’s ability to see all the relevant aspects of agriculture.

It takes only a cursory survey of the news media and a sampling of the opinions of agricultural policy makers and experts to recognize that the model of agriculture portrayed in Figure 24.2 has enormous influence. It is the source of many of the taken-for-granted assumptions that underlie much of the public discussion of agriculture, hunger, population growth, and land use. Only with this model shaping public discourse, for example, could the 2013 World Food Prize be awarded to three individuals with key roles in developing GMO crops. Even those who are concerned about the negative environmental and social impacts of industrial agriculture find it hard to break free from the limits this model places on their thinking.

**POLITICAL ECONOMY AND**

**ECOLOGY OF FOOD SYSTEMS**

A more complete model of agriculture’s place in society, one that doesn’t lead to systematic biases and blind spots, has, first of all, all the characteristics of the food-system model discussed in Chapter 2. That is, it includes social structures such as markets and government policies, recognizes that market mechanisms and price play important roles in how food is actually distributed among people, accounts for the diversity and complexity of production processes and the fact that much of agricultural production consists of nonfood industrial crops, and understands how agricultural

**304** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

production depends on and interacts with natural systems and the environment.

But to fully account for the role agriculture plays in the lives of actual human beings around the world, a better model must also take into account—and help explain the causes of—the inequities that exist in every aspect of the global food system. It must look at and understand differences in wealth between countries and regions, differences in access to food between classes of people, and differences among people in their ability to own land, have control over their life circumstances, and effect changes in the food system itself.

All of these aspects of inequality are wrapped up in the concept of _power_, one of the key concepts of the social sciences. A basic definition of power is that it is the overall ability to influence the behavior of others. But this simple definition, which conceives of power as an attribute of the individual, misses some of the key features of power as we are employing the term here. Power is a function of one’s position relative to societal and cultural structures—most especially the divisions that exist along the lines of class, race, and gender—which means that power at the individual level depends on wealth, status, group membership, and access to knowledge. To the extent these things are passed on from generation to generation, power tends not to be redistributed. Also, and very importantly, power exists at a level beyond that of the individual: it is wielded by groups, corporations, governments, and nations as much as by individuals.

In the context of agriculture, a useful definition of individual power is the relative ability to control the circumstances and destiny of one’s life, which is in turn critically dependent on access to and control of the resources (land, seeds, water, others’ labor, etc.) needed to provide for one’s needs, not the least important of which is food. By this gauge, billions of people around the world essentially have no power whatsoever, whereas a small minority—we can call them the elite—have so much power that it is difficult to even compare the two (Figure 24.3).

**FIGURE 24.3** **High-input, mechanized potato fields in rich** **bottomland near Quito, Ecuador (left), and peasant farming** **plots on resource-limited hilly land nearby (right).** Participants in the global food system often have vastly different levels of power.

The unequal distribution of power within and between societies is arguably the most important factor shaping people’s daily lives and experiences (Domhoff 2013). Likewise, the expression and maintenance of power are probably the most important determinants of the ways societies operate (Mills and Wolfe 2000). For these reasons, looking at issues of power is extraordinarily important for understanding anything humans do, including growing food. Many sociologists and political scientists, among others, accept this conclusion almost as an axiom; those who study agriculture and make the policies that govern it have, for a variety of reasons, been slower to embrace it.

Issues of power are _political_ in the broad sense of the term. They go beyond the narrow sense of electoral politics and the contests of political parties. Big-picture politics has to do with recognizing the unequal distribution of power and taking action to challenge it. This kind of politics often exists outside the arenas of government, law, and policy, and it can take many forms.

A central message of this chapter is that agroecology needs to see the food system from the standpoint of the distribution of power—among farmers, among the eaters of food, and among all the many other components of the system. That is, this chapter encourages students of agroecology to view the food system through a political lens. When you do this, one key feature of the food system stands out right away: most of the power is held by the wealthier nations, agrofood corporations, those who run and own these corporations, and those who own large tracts of land (Holt-Gimenez and Patel 2009; Hauter 2012). As we will see, the failure to take power and power differences into account is related very directly to beliefs that lead to support of the current system of industrial agriculture.

Although we tend to think of our food as being produced by “farmers”—a word that conjures up images of small family farms—the bulk of the food consumed in the developed world is inseparable from a global system dominated by a relative handful of large corporations, commonly referred to as agribusiness. Their control extends to every level of food production and distribution: supply of the factors of production (seeds, agrochemicals, fertilizers, farm machinery, etc.), ownership of land, production of feed for livestock, livestock production, production of most major crops, food processing and transportation, wholesale distribution, and retail sales. In this vast system, food is treated as a **commodity** —an item valued for its ability to generate wealth for those who own agribusiness corporations and their various forms of capital. Because of its scope, the corporate-dominated food system tends to draw all food into its gravitational field—that is, it acts to **commodify** food in general, to turn all food into a commodity. Even when food is produced on a farm that could still be accurately termed a “small family farm”, the owner of that farm will likely find it difficult to keep his or her corn or broccoli or hogs from being caught up in the

**FIGURE 24.4** **Corporate ownership of organic food brands in North America.** Most of the organic food brands are owned by larger agrofood corporations.

corporate-dominated, commodity-oriented network of food processing, distribution, and sales.

In most of the countries of the world, it is difficult as a consumer to avoid supporting these corporate food giants. Many of the companies that sell food products labeled as “organic,” “biological,” “natural,” and “ecological,” for example, are actually owned by larger transnational corporations (see Figure 24.4).

But why does it matter that ownership of farmland, seeds, fertilizer, food processing facilities, and transportation and distribution networks is in the hands of corporations? What does this have to do with power and inequality? The most direct answer to this question is that agrofood corporations control enormous amounts of wealth and own much of the physical and financial infrastructure of agricultural production, and this is both a cause and a consequence of holding enormous _power_ relative to other actors in the food system. Nestlé, for example, which operates in wholesale and retail food markets worldwide, has annual revenues of about $122 billion, which is more than the gross national products

of many of the countries in the world. United States-based Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), with annual revenue in excess of $90 billion, dominates food processing, manufacturing, and distribution. It too, controls more wealth than exists in some individual countries.

The enormous wealth of agrofood corporations translates into considerable power to shape the food system according to their needs and self-interests. They can influence government legislation, set prices artificially high, shape consumer behavior, negotiate favorable terms for expansion through buyouts, and contain threats to their dominance.

Although corporations’ role in the global food system is so dominant that some researchers have described the cur rent system as a “corporate food regime” (McMichael 2009; Hauter 2012), corporations are not alone in exercising control over food production, distribution, and consumption. They enlist as allies all sorts of other institutions, even those ostensibly outside the profit-making realm. According to McMichael (2009), a leading proponent of the food regime idea, the other institutions that make up the current corporate

**306** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

food regime include government ministries, global agricultural institutions, land grant universities, think tanks, and big philanthropic foundations. All with a stake in maintaining the dominance of the corporate food regime, these institutions act in concert with agrofood corporations to enforce unwritten “rules” about how the food system should function. They also promote a certain way of perceiving agriculture— one that supports the status quo of industrial methods and corporate control and is distinctly nonpolitical.

There is a general reluctance (or inability) among many scholars, planners, policy makers, officials, commentators, and people in general to see food and food production in terms of power, wealth concentration, and inequality. This widespread refusal to see agriculture in the “deeply political” way discussed earlier puts a great many important issues off limits—not just for discussion but for construction _as_ issues. In other words, the prevailing nonpolitical orientation toward agriculture tends to keep certain issues out of our consciousness entirely—in particular the wealth and power of agrofood corporations and the very unequal distribution of power in the whole food system.

It is true that food issues in general do become “political” at times. Citizens and their elected officials argue about whether foods derived from GMO crops should be labeled or not, for example. In another good example, periodically the US Congress wrangles over the size of the subsidies provided for in the annual agricultural appropriations bill, and this receives some attention in the news media. But issues like

these are nearly always discussed in the public arena in narrow terms that leave the fundamental issues unchallenged. The size of producer subsidies in the United States is important, of course, but the existence of the subsidies is rarely questioned, and members of Congress don’t generally discuss the role of the subsidies in encouraging consolidation in commodity production and pushing out small farmers. Similarly, in the GMO labeling debate (Figure 24.5), the proponents of labeling push the labels as ways of protecting consumers

**FIGURE 24.5** **Slogans from campaigns to require labeling** **of GMO foods.** Although their focus on consumer protection makes their goals realistic, such campaigns often fail to point out the relationships between GMOs, corporate control of agriculture, and unsustainability. In this way, they fail to enter a deeper level of political debate that might call into question more fundamental aspects of the food system.

from the hypothesized (and in some cases probably nonexistent) health risks of GMO foods instead of using the issue as a way of showing citizens how the use of most current GMO crops increases corporate control over food production and locks farmers into an unsustainable cycle of pest control escalation.

If we exclude the narrowly political treatment of foodrelated issues and look for evidence of more deeply political engagement with food-system issues, we find little of it—at least in developed countries where the majority of citizens have good food security. Deeply political orientations exist everywhere, of course, but what controls the parameters of public debate are the orientations of the mainstream—the bulk of citizens and those among them who shape policy and manage economies—and in general the mainstream view in many countries is to think of and treat food and food production in a nonpolitical way.

Consider that symbol of food convenience that becomes ubiquitous in the United States and much of the developed world: the hamburger. When you want a hamburger, what factors cross your mind? If you are like most people you probably don’t consider where the cattle from which the meat was derived were raised, or what they ate. You probably don’t wonder who owns the land on which they were raised, or who owns the land on which their feed was grown, or who owns the facility in which the grain for their feed was processed. You probably don’t care how the money you pay for the hamburger is distributed among the many people involved in getting the hamburger into your hands, from the server at the restaurant to the owner of the meat-processing plant. Even further from your mind is your role, as consumer, in putting smaller ranching operations out of business or fattening the profits of the drug company providing the grower with antibiotics. No, if you are like most people, you think mostly about the price, taste, serving size, and the reputation and image of the outlet selling the burger. If health and diet issues are a concern, you might care if the beef is grass fed or not—although that’s not likely a choice anyway. In short, in buying a hamburger you are acting as a consumer, and food consumption—for most people with the money to buy a hamburger—is a nonpolitical act.

And food consumption, remember, is the most direct way in which people interact with the food system. If the consumption of food is not viewed in political terms, it’s not likely that the food system in general will be seen this way either.

To understand why the food system and its industrial agriculture basis are so resistant to critique, and why they receive so much implicit and explicit support from policy makers, governments, and businesses, we can begin by returning to the model of agriculture depicted in Figure 24.2. There is nothing remotely political—that is, nothing related to or suggestive of an unequal distribution of power—in this model. Consumers and “farmers” are on an equal footing; all “farmers” are characterized as friendly smallholders. But the absence of any power-mediated relationships is not the only failing of this model. It misleads people into thinking that by

Agriculture, Society, and Agroecology **307**

exercising choice in their expression of “demand”, they have a certain kind of power. But this power is trivial compared to the kind of power we have been discussing. By highlighting this trivial power of consumer choice, the model hides the kind of power that really matters.

How did an oversimple model of agriculture’s function in society come to have so much influence over agricultural policy and development, and even over the way that the public in general perceives the food system? Why, in other words, is food nonpolitical?

**C** **ontaining** **T** **hreats** **to** **C** **orporate**

**C** **ontrol** **of** **the** **F** **ood** **S** **ystem**

If citizens in developed countries were fully aware of how corporate control shapes the nature of the food system— and therefore their lives and potentially those of their grandchildren—they might not be particularly happy. A clear picture of the concentration of wealth and ownership in the hands of top agrofood executives, an understanding of the extent to which the wealth and power of these individuals is dependent on the practices of industrial agriculture, and knowledge of the ways in which treating food as a commodity puts the health of people and the environment at risk— all would generate concern, resentment, and anger. People would question the fairness, ethics, and legitimacy of a system that disempowers large numbers of people and puts at risk the future productivity of the world’s agricultural lands in order to generate wealth in the present for a relative few. Since mass protests against agrofood corporations and popular movements to completely reshape the food system are limited and sporadic, it is reasonable to conclude that the requisite amounts of knowledge and awareness are not present. Why?

One way to answer this question is to invoke the currency of the simple economic model of agriculture depicted in Figure 24.2, but that just begs the question of why this model is so pervasive in the first place. To answer this deeper question, we have to introduce the often-contentious term **ideology** . An ideological system is a set of beliefs and taken-for-granted assumptions about the way the world works. A variety of ideological systems exist in the world, but most—including the one that protects the status quo of the food system—share the characteristic of coming into being to stabilize a society or social arrangement based on a very unequal distribution of power and wealth.

A society with a particularly skewed distribution of power, where a powerful minority benefits at the expense of a relatively powerless majority, is inherently unstable. The powerless have every reason to resist this arrangement and rebel. Knowing this, the powerful are careful to take steps to protect their advantage. Throughout history, this has often taken the form of securing a monopoly on the use of force. Monarchs, ruling classes, ruling parties, and dominant institutions have typically employed armies, special guards, and secret police to make it clear to their subjects, vassals, or citizens that any attempt to

alter or question the distribution of power would be met with violence–force.

But sustaining the threat of violence is not the only way that powerful groups maintain their power. Nearly every powerful regime that has existed in the world has also built around itself a protective shell consisting of ideas and beliefs. These ideas and beliefs _legitimize_ the regime’s power by convincing those subject to that power that the regime is doing what is necessary to restore or maintain a divinely dictated order, to repel external threats, or to see to the needs of the people. Ultimately, legitimizing ideas and beliefs are more powerful than armies and police forces, and easier and less costly to maintain. When a system of legitimizing ideas and beliefs has taken hold in a society, it gives the order imposed by those in power a natural and taken-for-granted character—that is, people begin to find it difficult to imagine any alternatives or mount any fundamental critique or opposition. Because of the effectiveness of legitimizing beliefs and taken-for-granted assumptions, powerful groups in more recent times—particularly in democratic societies—have been able to dispense altogether with coercion based on the threat of force and to maintain their positions of power entirely through ideas and beliefs.

Although we can look back at regimes, empires, and dictators in the past—or at current regimes vilified by the societies in which we live—and see their legitimizing belief systems as “ideology” or their more explicit efforts at inculcating these beliefs as “propaganda”, it is not so easy to look at our own societies and recognize that similar things are going on. The basic reason for this should be obvious: as members of our societies, we are necessarily immersed in our society’s belief systems, and these beliefs, by definition, don’t advertise themselves _as_ beliefs, but rather as taken-forgranted descriptions of reality.

For this reason, it won’t necessarily ring true for you that our own corporate-dominated food system is insulated from criticism and protected from threats by an ideology. But that is a succinct and accurate way of describing the situation. The ideological system surrounding the corporatedominated food system focuses our attention on the trivial “power” involved in consumers choosing food products, obscures the ways in which real power differences in the food system reinforce highly unequal outcomes in society, and convinces us that yield is all that matters in the realm of food production. In other words, it systematically limits the terms of any debate about the growing of food. The corporate actors in the food system can’t be criticized because the ideological framework associates them with all the positives of the system and dissociates them from the negatives; the social and environmental harms of industrial agriculture are framed as mere side effects rather than as inevitable consequences of a fundamentally flawed approach to agriculture. Perhaps most powerfully, the ideological system surrounding the food system convinces people that they have a stake in the survival and smooth functioning of the system—if you want that hamburger, you’d better not rock the boat.

**308** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

If an ideological system surrounds and protects the food system, then an even broader ideological system must exist at the level of the larger economic and political order in which the food system is embedded, with the two reinforcing each other. This larger ideological system, which legitimizes free-market capitalism, hinges on the widely held belief that the self-interested pursuit of profit in free markets insures both economic progress and the distribution of its benefits among all people. In the food system, this belief has the corollary that free markets, private ownership, and profit seeking are what make all of the benefits of the current food system possible, namely abundance, diversity, and choice. Even though these are bedrock assumptions for many, they are ideological because they require that one ignore a very consequential facet of reality. Although the self-interested pursuit of profit in free markets is indeed responsible for much of what we think of as “progress,” it is also the mainspring—to limit the list to the food system alone—of the industrial approach to agriculture and the concentration of power in the hands of agribusiness. Acknowledging both the positive and negative consequences of free-market capitalism—which might help undermine faith in the legitimacy of the corporate-dominated food system—is difficult when the ideology of the free market is strong and widespread in society.

One of the reasons why many people are uncomfortable with the notion of ideology existing in their own societies (or affecting their own thinking) is that they think of ideology as something that it is imposed deliberately on others by people conscious of what they are doing. For the most part, however, this is not how ideologies work. Those in positions of power, who benefit the most from the ideologies that legitimize their power, often accept the elements of those ideologies as unquestioningly as anyone. They are not cynically trying to convince others of something they know is false or

**FIGURE 24.6** **The illusion of choice on the cereal shelf.** Despite the large number of cereal types and brands, the primary ingredients are sugar and a few basic grains. The ideological system surrounding the food system leads consumers to celebrate this choice as a form of power and to ignore the consequences of corporate actors holding much of the real power in the food system.

misleading; they sincerely believe they are doing what’s right and even working to make the world a better place. Moreover, the ideas and beliefs that make up an ideological system cannot generally be dismissed as being merely “false.” Most contain some degree of truth; that is, in fact, what makes them so powerful. It’s only when they articulate with all the other elements of the ideological system that ideas and beliefs gain the ability to obscure certain realities and make a particular structure of social arrangements seem natural and inevitable. Thus, ideologies must be understood as all encompassing and largely invisible—integrated belief systems that have powerful effects precisely because people aren’t aware of using them to guide their thinking and perception.

An example of an ideological construction may serve to illustrate these ideas. The transnational agrofood corporation ADM identifies itself as “a vital link between farmers and consumers.” On its face, the statement is truthful—the company focuses on processing raw agricultural products and then distributing them, so it is accurate to think of it as a “link” between farmers and consumers. Further, there is no doubt that the top executives at ADM take this description of their company’s role as an element of faith and are proud of it. And yet, this statement is irrefutably ideological: it obscures the fact in serving as this link in the way it does, ADM insures that billions of the dollars consumers spend on food every year go not to the farmers but to the company’s owners and stockholders. It also obscures the fact that in the

process of becoming this “vital link” since its incorporation in 1923, ADM has done more to promote the commodification of agriculture than perhaps any other single entity in the world (Hauter 2012).

Because ideologies aren’t belief systems imposed on the gullible masses by those who know better, but are more accurately described as systems that condition everyone’s thinking, it is not quite right to say that those with power create ideologies and use them to maintain their power. However, it can’t be denied that in the global food system, the powerful benefit hugely from an ideology that makes the current system seem to be the best of all possible worlds. It is also true that those with power are the ones who do the work of promoting, distributing, maintaining and strengthening the elements of this legitimizing ideology through advertising and public relations, and through the educational, funding, governing, and media efforts of the aforementioned allies. Given these realities about the way ideology functions in the food system, it is not unreasonable to say that agrofood corporations and others with the most power have a clear stake in maintaining the food system’s ideology—which is essentially the same thing as saying they have a stake in keeping food and agriculture nonpolitical. They may not always do this consciously, but they do it, because it is in line with their interests.

**L** **ink** **between** **I** **nequality** **and** **U** **nsustainability**

You might be wondering why this chapter has been focusing so much on beliefs, inequality in human societies, and the

Agriculture, Society, and Agroecology **309**

relationship between the two. Why should we, as agroecologists, be concerned with these issues? Inequality is unquestionably a social evil when it is manifested as food insecurity, short life expectancy, and low quality of life for billions, but what does it have to do with sustainability? This question needs to be answered directly before we begin to explore, for the field of agroecology, the implications of power and ideology in agriculture.

We’ve actually touched on the answer to this question throughout this chapter in linking the “power structure” and corporate control of agriculture to the industrial practices discussed in Chapter 1. Because of these links, inequality in agriculture goes hand in hand with its unsustainability.

In many ways, inequality is a direct cause of some aspects of the food system’s unsustainability. Dispossessed from their land, for example, the rural poor are more likely to pursue environmentally destructive practices on marginal land to survive (e.g., González de Molin 2013). In addition, the flip side of this poverty—the relative affluence of urban consumers in developed and emerging economies—is a precondition and cause of food overconsumption and waste. But the more significant link is that social harms like hunger and poverty and environmental harms like greenhouse gas emissions and soil degradation arise from the same ultimate causes. The practices that maintain and exacerbate inequality in agriculture (proprietary technologies, intensification, monoculture, etc.) and the economic structures under which these practices exist are the very same things that most broaden agriculture’s negative ecological footprint.

One can also argue that the social consequences of the continued dominance of the corporate food regime in agriculture are as unsustainable as its ecological consequences. Growing numbers of people who formerly engaged in smallscale and subsistence agriculture in the rural parts of the world are being displaced from their land as corporations (and, in the case of China, states) apply the priorities dictated by the market dynamics of the food system; these people are ending up unemployed or poorly employed in urban centers, often worse off than they were before (Holt-Gimenez and Patel 2009) (Figure 24.7). Such a trend cannot continue without consequences for social stability, especially with continued population growth. Together, therefore, the social and ecological harms arising from the global food system lead the system toward a future when its unsustainability threatens to become manifest.

Underlying all these relationships is a fundamental aspect of the food system: it prioritizes the accumulation of wealth over the satisfaction of food needs. Every part of the system, from farmworkers and growers to global corporations, participates in a process of extracting value from plants, soil, human labor, machines, and fossil-fuel energy and siphoning it upward to shareholders and owners. In this system, profit making is an imperative, overshadowing everything else, including maintaining the long-term health of the soil, providing wholesome food, and treating farm laborers fairly.

Maximizing the generation of wealth entails certain goals and methods. Just as in manufacturing—the model

**FIGURE 24.7** **A settlement of displaced people on the urban** **fringe of Cartagena, Colombia.** As the large-scale, mechanized systems of industrial agriculture replace traditional rural systems in the developing world, there are both social and ecological costs. The social costs include growing urban poverty, as former peasants are displaced from their land by the expansion of industrial agricultural systems and move to urban centers with inadequate employment opportunities.

for industrial agriculture—the highest possible profit comes from reducing labor costs, controlling sources of raw materials, externalizing environmental and social costs, making production as efficient as possible, and keeping prices high. From these goals and methods come the practices of industrial agriculture, which produce both social and ecological harms, as detailed in Chapter 1. As long as the economic logic of the food system demands that wealth be accumulated and concentrated upward, the model of industrial agriculture will persist as the most rational and efficient means for allowing this to happen. And as long as industrial agriculture dominates the food system, the world’s poorest people and the planet’s life-support systems will continue to bear the brunt of its costs—with the consequences eventually extending to

everyone.

**BROADENING THE AGROECOLOGICAL**

**PERSPECTIVE**

Recall the question that opened this chapter: why is human society pursuing an unsustainable path in agriculture? Now we are in a position to better answer this question. The answer has a number of interrelated parts:

- The unsustainability of the current food system

derives in large part from a central dynamic of the system: it is organized around the pursuit of private profit and the passing-off of costs onto societies and natural systems (the “public” sphere).

- As a system that prioritizes profit seeking and

wealth accumulation, the food system disproportionately benefits a relative minority of people:

**310** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

those who own land, control the means of production and distribution, and own the corporations that dominate the system.

- If everyone recognized these key aspects of the food

system—that it generates inequality, concentrates power and wealth, and degrades the natural systems on which food production depends—then the food system would not be seen as legitimate.

- In part because those with the most power have a

huge stake in the way the system functions, a system of beliefs and ideas—an ideology—has grown around the food system and hidden from view the aspects that would cause people to question its legitimacy.

- The food system’s ideology works to legitimate the

food system, making it seem inevitable and natural and systematically limiting the kinds of thinking that could coalesce into a serious challenge to its dominance.

Putting these parts together, we can see why the food system continues on its present trajectory even though agroecologists and those in allied fields have pointed out—and supported with solid evidence—that this trajectory will lead to a future no one wants. As long as the ideological system that legitimizes the food system remains unchallenged, and as long as the food system can continue to generate the profits that sustain it and deliver the surface-level benefits on which its ideological system depends, then it will continue on its current path.

This conclusion has clear implications for agroecology as a field. If agroecology hopes to elicit fundamental change in the food system, it must do more than point out the unsustainable nature of the system in ecological terms or design more sustainable techniques—it must challenge the ideological system that protects the corporate food regime and it must take issue with the concentration of power and the unequal distribution of wealth that lie at the heart of the way the food system operates (Holt-Gimenez and Patel 2009; González de Molin 2013).

**D** **elegitimizing** **the** **G** **lobal** **F** **ood** **S** **ystem**

As argued earlier, a system of beliefs and assumptions—an ideological system—insulates the corporate-dominated food system from challenges. It does this primarily by making corporate control of the food system and the practices of industrial agriculture seem entirely legitimate—that is, right, proper, and necessary for promoting the common good. If there is any chance of altering the direction in which the food system is heading, it lies in calling into question the beliefs and assumptions of the ideological system that protect the food system and its status quo. In this way, the food system can be delegitimized and understood as a threat to the future. A direct way of poking holes in the food system’s ideology is to challenge the taken-for-granted assumptions that make up its substance. These assumptions include the following:

- It does not matter who produces our food, or how

they do it, as long as there is enough of it.

- Yield is the only variable to consider when looking

at the satisfaction of food needs.

- Food shortages around the world are the result of

inefficient and incomplete application of modern agricultural techniques and of western-style markets.

- Eliminating hunger requires an increase in agricul tural productivity.

- The more urban dwellers in the world the better,

because their consumption drives economic growth.

- Working directly to produce food—getting one’s

hands dirty in the soil—is a form of drudgery from which all people should be liberated.

- Competition in our market-based economy insures

that food will be produced in the most efficient way possible, lowering prices and increasing supply.

- Consumer demand and the market drive everything

that food producers do—and rightly so.

- Most problems in the agricultural sphere have tech nical solutions.

Challenging assumptions like these happens at two levels. The first is personal and internal: you need to recognize that a particular assumption is an assumption and not a description of reality, that it limits your thinking, that it describes reality imperfectly, and that it is part of a larger ideological system that limits your thinking. The second level is external and expressly political: disputing the assumption in the public sphere, convincing others that it hides relationships of power that should be laid bare, articulating what those relationships of power actually are, and consciously changing the kind of role you play in the food system. Some of the resources listed in the Internet Resources and Recommended

Readings section can be helpful at both of these levels.

Challenging an ideological system is always difficult. Those who hold the beliefs being challenged will resist, for obvious reasons, any overturning of their worldview, and they will likely claim you are guilty of hubris for assuming you have clear vision and they don’t. But taking a critical perspective with respect to the ideological system that supports industrial agriculture is not the same as claiming you are outside that system and immune from its effects. Nor does it mean that you have managed to free yourself from other ideological systems as well. What it does entail is an awareness of ideologies and how they “work”—the systematic ways they influence people’s thinking (including your own) and the roles they play in supporting systems based on relationships of power.

**C** **hanging** **the** **F** **ood** **S** **ystem**

A deeply political analysis of the food system and an understanding of the ideology that protects it are necessary for changing the system, but they are not sufficient. Once we understand the fundamental issues, we have a better idea

Agriculture, Society, and Agroecology **311**

of what needs to change, but we don’t have tools and strategies for effecting those changes. For this reason, political analysis and critique must be joined by political, social, and economic actions. This entails a considerable broadening of agroecology’s goals and perspective, an expansion that makes it a _social movement_ in addition to an academic field or discipline.

Working for concrete changes in society and in the food system may be slow and incremental, but it has the important effect of supporting the effort to delegitimize the current world food system, its corporate control and its reliance on industrial agricultural practices. As real alternatives are created—or even just proposed and advocated for—people can more readily see the flaws in the current system and recognize that the food system as a whole could be structured otherwise.

Working out the strategies and goals that agroecology should adopt as a social movement focused on changing the food system is a large topic. We will explore this topic in more depth in the next two chapters. Some of the basic elements of a social-movement approach in agroecology are the following:

**• Rely on farmer-generated agroecological knowl-**

**edge.** Understand how this knowledge is a necessary part of developing more sustainable food systems that provide alternatives to the industrial agriculture paradigm (Altieri 2004; Altieri and Toledo 2011; Gliessman 2013; Martinez-Torres and Rosset 2014).

**• Embrace a transdisciplinary approach.** Engage

with and integrate various disciplines and knowledge systems (including indigenous and traditional ones) to emphasize practical problem solving (Wilken 1988; Altieri 2004; Fish et al. 2008; Francis et al. 2008; Méndez et al. 2013).

**• Integrate research and action.** Involve a diversity

of stakeholders as active participants in an iterative process in which practical research informs social-change efforts and those efforts lead to new knowledge, which inspires more research, and so on (Bacon et al. 2005; Eksvärd et al. 2009; Méndez et al. 2013).

**• Build tomorrow’s food system today, in micro-**

**cosm.** Through community-supported agriculture and other means, create local food networks that revitalize farming as a livelihood and bring consumers and farmers closer together (see Chapter 25).

**• Increase public awareness of food politics.**

Encourage people to overcome the consumer sensibility and become food citizens who are aware of the political, economic, and social consequences of every act of consumption (see Chapter 25).

**• Foster a food justice movement.** Through a clear

understanding of the need for change, the current alternative food movement can become a force for

resistance and food justice for everyone (Borras et al. 2008; Goodman et al. 2011).

A disquieting consequence of understanding the depth of the food system’s embeddedness in extraordinarily resilient social and economic structures is the recognition that changing the food system in any fundamental way will be very difficult. Changing the food system is a big order because at a fundamental level it means changing the way human beings relate to nature, land, resources, the earth’s biota, and each other. But these relationships need to change anyway if humanity is going to successfully confront the challenges posed by climate change, widespread ecological collapse, and population growth. In this sense, agroecology is part of a larger movement aimed at insuring long-term human survival.

**A** **voiding** **C** **ooptation**

The corporate-dominated food system has a tremendous capacity for defusing and absorbing demands for change. It does this through a process of cooptation, in which the demands are met on a superficial level, satisfying enough people to take the wind out of the movement’s sails without affecting the more fundamental characteristics of the regime. The organic food movement is a good example (Guthman 2004). Although the movement from which it originated may remain a source of serious challenges, the “corporate regime” has turned the demand for organically grown food into an issue of personal health and choice, directing all the movement’s energy into those arenas and away from the more fundamental demand that food be grown at a smaller scale with fewer inputs of any kind. A direct sign of this cooptation is that most organic growers, distributors, and processors have been bought up by larger agrofood corporations so that organic food can become just one more option among consumers’ choices (Howard 2009; see Figure 24.4). This satisfies most consumers without changing the system in a truly fundamental way. Although the food is produced in accordance with the rules of organic labeling, it has nevertheless been brought into the orbit of industrial production: it is large scale, intensive, mostly lacking in diversity, and dependent on inputs (Figure 24.8).

The power of a deeply political critique of the food system is that it can avoid cooptation. A deeply political critique, by definition, focuses on the fundamental characteristics of the system—the concentration of wealth, the unequal distribution of power, and the social and ecological costs of the profit-making imperative—which cannot be modified without a transformation of the whole system. Demands for healthier food, or food produced without pesticides, can be accommodated by the corporate food regime; demands for returning food production to those who live on and understand the land cannot. The latter type of demand retains its power to challenge the corporate food regime itself. It activates an alternative paradigm, a different standpoint from which the ideological cloak of the food system is seen for what it is, and from which an alternative future can be imagined.

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**

1. The so-called “Green Revolution” led to new agri cultural technologies and significant crop yields in some sectors of agriculture, but the number of hungry people in the world today is larger than ever. Why did the green revolution not solve the problem of hunger? 2. In his book of essays _What Are People For?_ (1990),

Wendell Berry wrote the following: “Eating is an agricultural act…. There is, then, a politics of food that, like any politics, involves our freedom. We still (sometimes) remember that we cannot be free if our minds and voices are controlled by someone else. But we have neglected to understand that we cannot be free if our food and its sources are controlled

by someone else. The condition of the passive consumer of food is not a democratic condition. One

reason to eat responsibly is to live free.” What is Berry saying here, and what do you think about it? 3. Agroecologists have as much to learn from farm ers as they do from science. What sorts of insights about how to make the food system more sustainable might farmers have that would be difficult to gain purely from scientific research? 4. Describe an example of “food democracy” in

action. It could be something you’ve experienced firsthand (e.g., a local election) or something you’ve read about. What is the democratic essence of your example? To what extent did the example politicize agriculture in the deep sense described in this chapter? 5. Paradigm shifts are said to require major ideologi cal change. In order for food justice to be a part of the paradigm shift in food systems, what kinds of changes in ideology need to occur?
