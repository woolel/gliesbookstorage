## 8. Soil

The word _soil_, in its broadest sense, refers to that portion
of the earth’s crust where plants are anchored; this includes
everything from the deep soils of a river bottomland to a
crevice in a rock with a bit of dust and plant debris. More
specifically, the soil is that weathered superficial layer of the
earth that is mixed with living organisms and the products
of their metabolic activities and decay (Odum and Barrett
2005). Soil includes material derived from rocks, organic and
inorganic substances derived from living organisms, and the
air and water occupying the spaces between soil particles. As
a distinct ecological and geophysical zone, the soil is often
referred to as the **pedosphere** ( _pedon_ is the ancient Greek
word for soil or earth).

Soil is a complex, living, changing, and dynamic component of the agroecosystem. It is subject to alteration, and can
either be degraded or wisely managed. In much of present-day
agriculture, with the availability of an array of mechanical
and chemical technologies for rapid soil modification, soil
is all too often viewed primarily as a growth medium,
something from which to extract a harvest. Farmers often
take the soil for granted, and pay little attention to the complex ecological processes that take place below the surface.
The premise of this chapter, in contrast, is that a thorough
understanding of the ecology of the soil system is a key part
of comprehending the soil as an environmental factor affecting crop plants, and therefore in designing and managing sustainable agroecosystems.

As an ecosystem unto itself, soil is more complex than the
other factors of the environment we have considered so far.

This complexity requires that we step outside the boundaries of the autecological perspective to understand the interactions within the soil ecosystem and the ways in which
farming practices affect this system. In this sense the soil
is also far from being an _a_ biotic factor like those we have
examined up to this point. It is very much alive, as we will
discuss in this chapter. Nevertheless, even as we consider all
the interacting components of the soil ecosystem, including
the biotic, we can still understand the soil as a totality, an
environmental factor much like wind or temperature that has
particular effects on crop plants and can be managed for the
benefit of the agroecosystem.


**PROCESSES OF SOIL FORMATION**

**AND DEVELOPMENT**


From an agricultural perspective, an “ideal” soil is made up
of 45% minerals, 5% organic matter, and 50% space, with the
space filled half with water and half with air. It is hard to find



anything that we can call a typical soil, however, since each
site or location has unique properties that ultimately determine the final outcome of the soil formation process.

Biological processes combine with physical and chemical
processes in each particular climatic region and location to
form soil. Once formed, soil changes and develops due to
these and other biological, physical, and chemical processes.
With variations in slope, climate, and type of vegetative
cover, many different soils can form in close juxtaposition
with one another, even though the parent material may be
fairly similar.

Natural processes of soil formation and development
take considerable time. For example, it is estimated that
only about 0.5–1.5 tons of topsoil/acre is formed annually in
areas of corn and wheat production in the central Midwest
region of the United States (Daily 1995). In contrast, about
4–5 tons of soil/acre is estimated to erode from convention
ally farmed land in these areas (NRCS 2010). Although this
estimated rate of soil erosion in the US Midwest represents a
reduction from previous years—an estimated 7 tons/acre in
1982, for example—it still overwhelms the ability of natural

processes to compensate.


**F** **ormation** **of** **R** **egolith**


As a whole, the layer of unconsolidated material between
the soil surface and the solid bedrock of the earth below is

called the **regolith** . The most basic element of the regolith
is its mineral component, made up of soil particles formed
from the breakdown of the bedrock or parent material. At
any particular location, these soil particles may have been
derived from the bedrock below, or they may have been
transported from elsewhere. Where a soil’s mineral particles
have been formed in place from the bedrock below, the soil
is a **residual soil** . Where the mineral particles have been carried from some other location by wind, water, gravity, or ice,
the soil is a **transported soil** .


**Physical Weathering**
The weathering of rock and rock minerals is the original
source of mineral soil particles, whether the particles remain
in a location or are moved elsewhere. The combined forces

of water, wind, temperature, and gravity slowly peel and
flake rock away, accompanied by the gradual decomposition
of the minerals themselves. Water can seep into cracks and
crevices in rock, and with heating and cooling causing alternating swelling and contracting, rock begins to fragment.
In addition, the carbon dioxide contained in the water that


**89**


**90** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



seeps into cracks can form carbonic acid, pulling elements
such as calcium and magnesium from the minerals of the
rock and forming carbonates, and in the process weakening the crystalline structure of the rock and making it more
susceptible to further physical weathering. Finer particles
mix with larger particles, promoted by the physical movement created by the combined forces of gravity, temperature
change, and alternating wetting and drying. Even the abrasive forces of rocks against each other during this movement
can form smaller particles. Eventually the unconsolidated
regolith takes form.

Depending on local conditions and geological history, the
regolith can be recently formed, lightly weathered, and made
up of mostly primary minerals, or it may have been subjected
to intensive weathering and be made up of more resistant
materials such as quartz.


**Transport**

As rock is broken down into smaller and looser materials, it
can remain in place and eventually form residual soils, but
a more likely fate is for it to be carried some distance and
deposited. The forces of wind, water movement, gravity, and
glacial ice movement can all transport weathered soil particles. Transported soils have different classifications depending on the manner in which their particles were transported.
Soil is called


  - **Colluvium** where it has been transported by gravity;

  - **Alluvium** where it has been transported by the

movement of water;

  - **Glacial soil** where it has been transported by the

movement of glaciers;

  - **Eolian soil** where it has been transported by wind.


**C** **hemical** **W** **eathering**


Once physical weathering has produced regolith, chemical
weathering can work on the soil as well. Chemical weathering includes natural chemical processes that aid in the breakdown of parent materials, the conversion of materials from
one form to another in the soil, and the movement of materials within the soil. Four different chemical processes are
of primary importance in soil formation and development:
hydration, hydrolysis, solution, and oxidation.

**Hydration** is the addition of water molecules to a mineral’s chemical structure. It is an important cause of crystal
swelling and fracturing. **Hydrolysis** occurs when various
cations of the original crystalline structure of silicate minerals are replaced by hydrogen ions, causing decomposition. In
regolith with low pH, the greater concentration of H+ accelerates hydrolysis. The release of organic acids as a by-product
of the metabolic activities of living organisms, or from the
decomposition of dead organic matter, can add to this process as well. **Solution** occurs when parent materials with a
high concentration of easily soluble minerals (such as nitrates
or chlorides) go into solution in water. Limestone is particularly susceptible to solution in the presence of water high



in carbonic acid; in extreme cases the solution of limestone

leads to the formation of limestone caves in areas of underground water flow. Finally, **oxidation** is the conversion of
elements such as iron from their original reduced form into
an oxidized form in the presence of water or air. Softening
of the crystalline structure usually accompanies this process.

Once minerals are released from the consolidated parent
material, another chemical process that is of great importance
is the formation of secondary minerals, the most important
being clay minerals. Clay mineralogy is a very complex field
of study, but it is important to understand some basic aspects
of clay formation, since they have such dramatic impacts on
plant growth and development.

Clay minerals are very small particles in the soil, but they
affect everything from water retention to nutrient availability,
as will be discussed elsewhere. They are formed by complex
processes in which silicate minerals are chemically modified
and reorganized. Depending on the combination of climatic
conditions and parent material, the secondary minerals that
are formed are of two basic types: **silicate clays** that are predominantly made up of microscopic aluminum silicate plates
with different arrangements and the presence or absence of
other elements such as iron and magnesium; and **hydroxide**
**clays** that lack a definite crystalline structure and are made
up of hydrated iron and aluminum oxides in which many of
the silicon ions have been replaced.

Eventually, the clays found in any soil will be a mixture
of many subtypes of these two basic types of secondary clay
minerals, although one or a few subtypes may predominate.
When silicate clays dominate, there are abundant sites for
absorbing cations, giving the soil a relatively high productive potential. When hydroxide clays dominate—as in many
humid tropical regions—fewer cation sites are available,
making the soil more difficult to farm because of its poor
ability to exchange nutrient cations.

Organic matter, from either plant residues or the activities
of living organisms, has important impacts on all of these
chemical weathering processes of parent material and greatly
accelerates the formation of the regolith.


**B** **iotic** **P** **rocesses**


Sooner or later, depending on the consistency of the regolith,
plants establish themselves on the weathered material. They
send roots down that draw nutrients from mineral matter,
store them for a while in plant matter, but eventually return
them to the soil surface. Deep roots further break down the
regolith, capture nutrients that have leached from the upper
surface, and add them to the soil surface in an organic form.
Plant residue then serves as an important source of energy
for the bacteria, fungi, earthworms, and other soil organisms
that establish in the area. Once these living components of
the soil become established, they play a primary role in controlling and accelerating further soil development, and then
in regulating and carrying out the biological, chemical, and
physical processes that are of such importance in maintaining soil fertility.


Soil **91**



Biologically mediated soil development occurs as the
living organisms in the soil break down plant residue and
other organic matter and slowly reduce it to simpler forms
and its most basic constituents. In the process of **decomposi-**
**tion**, freshly dead or excreted organic matter is broken down
by arthropods, earthworms, nematodes, protozoans, fungi,
and bacteria into ever smaller bits and simpler organic compounds as it passes through several trophic levels in the soil
food web. Decomposed organic matter can then undergo the
process of **humification**, in which it is transformed by soil
microbes and other organisms into relatively stable organic
compounds that are collectively termed **humus** . Humus
plays a significant role in soil structure, nutrient availability, and other soil characteristics, as we will see in the succeeding text. In the process of **mineralization**, humus and
other organic matter are broken down even further, mostly by
fungi and bacteria, into inorganic (or “mineral”) compounds
such as CO 2, N 2, salts, and H 2 O, some of which stays in the
soil and some of which enters the atmosphere.

Even though humus is relatively stable, it does have a
limited lifetime in the soil. Some of it is constantly being
mineralized, but new humus is also being continually
produced—as long as organic matter in some form is being
added to the soil. In healthy soils, an equilibrium point is
reached where the rate at which new humus forms is approximately equal to the rate at which it is removed from the soil
by mineralization.


**SOIL HORIZONS**


Over time, the localized chemical, physical, and biological
processes in the regolith lead to the development of observable layers in the soil, called **horizons** . Together, the horizons in a particular location give each soil a distinctive **soil**
**profile** . Each horizon of the soil profile has a distinct combination of characteristics.


**S** **oil** **P** **rofile**


In general terms, a soil profile is made up of four major horizons: the organic, or O horizon, and three mineral horizons.
The O horizon lies at the soil surface; immediately below
it is the A horizon, where organic matter accumulates and
where soil particle structure can be granular, crumblike, or
platy. Under the A horizon is the B horizon, where materials
leached from the A horizon can accumulate in the form of

silicates, clay, iron, aluminum, or humus, and soil structure
can be blocky, prismatic, or columnar. Finally there is the
C horizon, made up of weathered parent material, derived
either from the local parent material below or from material transported at some earlier time to that location. Some
material leached or deposited from the A and B horizons
can be found here, such as carbonates of calcium and magnesium, especially in areas of low rainfall. Depending on
the depth of the upper four horizons, an R horizon made up
of consolidated bedrock may also be included as part of the
soil profile.

**FIGURE** **8.1** **Generalized soil profile.**


Since the separations between each horizon are rarely distinct, these horizons described actually form a continuum in
the soil profile. A typical soil profile is presented in schematic form in Figure 8.1. The depth, characteristics, and differentiation of each horizon of each soil profile are the result
of the combined impacts of the properties of the soil material
(its color, organic matter content, and chemical and physical
traits), the type of vegetative cover, and the climate.

The processes that differentiate soil horizons function in
different ways depending on regional and local conditions.
These differences result in four basic types of soil development, which are summarized in Table 8.1. The process of
calcification is most characteristic of areas of grassland vegetation in subhumid-to-arid and temperate-to-tropical climates
of the world. Podzolization is most characteristic of humid,
temperate areas of the world where forests have been the dominant vegetative cover for a long time. Laterization takes place
on older and heavily weathered soils of the humid subtropical
and tropical forested regions of the world, and gleization is
most common on soils where water stays at or near the surface
for a good part of the year. But depending on localized conditions of slope, drainage, vegetation, depth to bedrock, etc.,
combinations of these processes can be found. On the whole,
soil formation and development is a reciprocal process, where
soil affects the vegetation, and the vegetation affects the soil.

In natural ecosystems, the O horizon is the most biologically
active part of the profile and the most important ecologically. It plays a significant role in the life and distribution of
plants and animals, the maintenance of soil fertility, and in
many soil-development processes. Macro- and microorganisms responsible for decomposition are most active in this

layer and in the upper part of the A horizon. Significantly,
the O horizon is usually greatly reduced or even absent from
cultivated soils.


The combination of local climate and vegetation type contributes to the conditions that promote activity in this layer;
yet at the same time, the quality of the layer has profound
influence on what kinds of organisms prosper. Bacteria, for
example, favor nearly neutral or slightly alkaline conditions,
whereas fungi favor more acid conditions. Soil-dwelling
mites and collembola are more important under acid conditions, whereas earthworms and termites tend to predominate
at or above neutrality.

The complex process of soil particle aggregation, which
creates what is called the crumb structure of the soil, is
greatly influenced by humus formed in the O horizon. In
addition, many valuable soil fertility processes, discussed
later in this chapter, are related closely to the ecological characteristics of this important layer.


**SOIL CHARACTERISTICS**


In order to develop and maintain a healthy soil system, as
well as make sound judgments about particular soil management strategies, it is important to understand some of
the most essential properties of soils as they affect crop

response.


**T** **exture**


Soil texture is defined as the percentage, by weight, of the total
mineral soil that falls into various particle size classes. These
size classes are gravel, sand, silt, and clay (see Table 8.2).
Particles greater than 2.0 mm in diameter are classified as
gravel. Sand is easily visible by the naked eye, and feels gritty
when rubbed between the fingers. Its low surface-to-volume
ratio makes it porous to water and less able to adsorb and
hold nutrient cations. Silt, although finer than sand, still is
grainy in appearance and feel, but more actively holds water
and nutrient ions. Clay particles are impossible to see separately with the naked eye, and look and feel like flour. Clay
particles are colloidal in that they can form a suspension in
water and are active sites for the adhesion of nutrient ions or

water molecules. As a result, clay controls the most important
soil properties, including plasticity and ion exchange between
soil particles and water in the soil. A soil very high in clay

content, however, can have problems with water drainage,
and when dry can exhibit cracking.

Most soils are a mixture of texture classes, and based on
the percentage of each class, soils are named as shown in
Figure 8.2. From an agricultural perspective, sand gives a
soil good drainage and contributes to ease of cultivation, but
a sandy soil also dries easily and loses nutrients to leaching.
Clay, at the other extreme, tends not to drain well and can
become easily compacted and difficult to work, yet is good at
holding soil moisture and nutrients.

What soil texture is best depends on the crops grown in it.
Potatoes, for example, do best in a sandy, well-drained soil,
which helps prevent rotting of the tubers and makes harvest easier. Paddy rice does best on heavy soils high in clay
content due to this crop’s particular adaptations to the wet
environment. A clay loam soil may be best overall in a drier
environment, whereas a sandy loam might be better in a wet
one. The addition of organic matter changes the relationships
of the particles in mixtures, as we will see below.


**S** **tructure**


In addition to the aspects of texture described earlier, soils
possess a macrostructure formed by the ways individual
particles are held together in clusters of different shapes and
sizes called aggregates (see Figure 8.3). Soil aggregates tend
to become larger with increasing depth in the soil. Soil texture is one important determinant of structure, but structure
is usually more dependent on soil organic matter (SOM)
content, the plants growing in the soil, the presence of soil

bound together resist wind and water erosion, especially
during any time of the year when vegetative cover is minimal. Good structure also helps maintain low **bulk density**,
defined as the weight of solids per unit volume of soil. Soil
with a low bulk density has a higher percentage of pore space
(higher porosity), more aeration, better water percolation
(permeability), and more water storage capacity. Obviously,
such a soil is easier to till and allows plant roots to penetrate
more easily. Excessive cultivation accelerates breakdown of
SOM and increases the potential for compaction, causing
bulk density to go up and many of the advantages of good
crumb structure to be lost.


The formation of soil aggregates has essentially two components: the attraction between individual soil particles, the
degree of which is very dependent on soil texture, and the
cementing of these attracted groups of particles by organic
matter. The first component cannot be very easily manipulated by the farmer, at least in any practical manner, but the
second can be very much impacted by farming practices.
Thus good crumb structure can be maintained, degraded, or
improved.

For example, excessive tillage with heavy equipment
while the soil is too wet can lead to the formation of large
blocky clods of soil that can dry on the surface and later be
broken apart only with great difficulty. Compaction, or the
loss of pore spaces and a rise in bulk density, is an indication of the loss of crumb structure, and can be caused by the
weight of farm machinery, by the loss of organic matter from
excessive tillage, or by a combination of the two.


**C** **olor**


Soil color plays its most important role in the identification
of soil types, but at the same time it can tell us much about



Percent sand


**FIGURE** **8.2** **Soil textural names.** The best type of soil is determined by the crop and local conditions; generally, however, soils

loams—are best for agricultural purposes. (USDA diagram.)


organisms, and the soil’s chemical status. The structure of
the crumb or granular type is of the most benefit for agriculture, since good “crumb structure” improves soil porosity
and ease of tillage, which together are known as **tilth** . When
a lump of soil is crushed in the hand, and easily breaks into
the crumb or granular structure noted in Figure 8.3, good
crumb structure is present.

From an agroecological perspective, good crumb structure is of considerable significance. Soil particles that are

the history of a soil’s development and management. Darkcolored soils are generally an indication of high organic matter content, especially in temperate regions. Red and yellow
soils generally indicate high levels of iron oxides, formed
under conditions of good aeration and drainage, but these
colors can also be derived directly from the parent material. Gray or yellow-brown colors can be indicators of poor
drainage; these colors form when iron is reduced to a ferrous
form rather than oxidized to the ferric form in the presence of
abundant oxygen. Whitish light-colored soils often indicate
the presence of quartz, carbonates, or gypsum. Standardized
color charts are used to determine a soil’s color.


Hence, a soil’s color can be an indicator of certain kinds of
soil conditions that a farmer might want to look for or avoid,
depending on the kinds of crops or cropping systems that might
be used. More specific analysis of soil structure and chemistry
is necessary to complete the picture, but color is a good beginning. In addition, soil color can influence the interaction of
the soil with other factors of the environment. For example, it
may be an advantage to have a lighter-colored, sandy soil on
the surface in some tropical farming systems in order to reflect
the sun’s rays and keep the soil cooler; conversely, a darker soil
surface in areas with cold winters will help the soil temperature rise earlier in the spring, dry the soil sooner, and permit
soil preparation for planting at an earlier date.


**C** **ation** **E** **xchange** **C** **apacity**


Plants obtain the mineral nutrients described in Chapters 2
and 3 from the soil in the form of dissolved ions, whose solubility is determined by their electrostatic attraction to molecules of water. Some important mineral nutrients, such as
potassium and calcium, are in the form of positively charged
ions; others, such as nitrate and phosphate, are in the form of
negatively charged ions. If these dissolved ions are not taken
up immediately through plant roots or fungi, they risk being
leached out of the soil solution.


Clay and humus particles, separately or in aggregates that
form platelike structures known as micelles, have negatively
charged surfaces that hold the smaller, more mobile positively
charged ions in the soil. The number of sites on the micelles
available for binding positively charged ions (cations) determines what is called soil **cation exchange capacity** (CEC),
which is measured in milliequivalents of cations per 100 g of
dry soil. The higher the CEC the better the soil’s ability to
hold and exchange cations, prevent leaching of nutrients, and
provide plants with adequate nutrition.

CEC varies from soil to soil, depending on the structure
of the clay/humus complex, the type of micelle present, and
the amount of organic matter incorporated into the soil.
Multisided polyhedrons form lattices that vary in their sites
of attraction and flexibility in relation to moisture content.
Cations cling to the negatively charged outer surfaces of the
micelles and humates with differing degrees of attraction.
The most tenacious cations—such as hydrogen ions added
by rain, positively charged acids from decomposing organic
matter, and acids given off by root metabolism—can displace



other important nutrient cations such as K [+] or Ca [2+] . Organic
matter in the form of humus is many times more effective
than clay in increasing CEC since it has a much more extensive surface area-to-volume ratio (hence more adsorption
sites) and because it is colloidal in nature. Farming practices
that reduce SOM content can also reduce this important component of soil fertility maintenance.

Negative ions that are important for plant growth and
development, such as nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate, are
more commonly adsorbed to clay micelles by means of ion
“bridges.” Under acid conditions these bridges form by association of additional hydrogen ions with functional groups
such as the hydroxyl group (OH). An important example is
the binding of nitrate (NO 3– ) with OH 2+ formed following

the dissociation of water molecules under acid conditions.
Because soil acidity influences electrical charge on micelle
surfaces and controls whether other ions are displaced from
soil micelles, it greatly affects the retention of ions in the soil
and the short-term availability of nutrients, both of which are
key components of soil fertility.


**S** **oil** **A** **cidity** **and** **p** **H**


Any experienced gardener or farmer is aware of the importance of a soil’s pH, or acid–base balance. The typical pH
range of soils is between very acid (a pH of 3) and strongly
alkaline (a pH of 8). Any soil over a pH of 7 (neutral) is considered basic, and those less than pH 6.6 are considered acid.
Few plants, especially agricultural crops, grow well outside
the pH range of 5–8. Legumes are particularly sensitive to
low pH due to the impacts acid soils have on the microbial
symbiont in nitrogen fixation. Bacteria in general are negatively impacted by low pH. Soil acidity is well known for its
effects on nutrient availability as well, but the effects are less
due to direct toxicity on the plant than they are to the plant’s
impaired ability to absorb specific nutrients at either very low
or very high pH. It becomes important, then, to find ways to
maintain soil pH in the optimal range.

Many soils increase in acidity through natural processes.
Soil acidification is a result of the loss of bases by leaching of water moving downward through the soil profile, the
uptake of nutrient ions by plants and their removal through
harvest or grazing, and the production of organic acids by
plant roots and microorganisms. Soils that are poorly buffered against these input or removal processes will tend to
increase in acidity.


**S** **alinity** **and** **A** **lkalinity**



It is common for the soils of arid and semiarid regions of
the world to accumulate salts, in either a soluble or insoluble form. Salts released by the weathering of parent material, combined with those added in limited rainfall, are not
removed by leaching. In areas of low rainfall and high evaporation rates, dissolved salts such as Na [+] and Cl [–] are common,
combined with others such as Ca [2+], Mg [2+], K [+], HCO 3–, and

NO 3– . Irrigation can add even more salts to the soil, especially


Soil **95**



in areas with a high evaporation potential (see Chapter 9),
where added salts migrate to the surface of the soil by capillary movement during evaporation. In addition, many inorganic fertilizers, such as ammonium nitrate, can increase
salinity as well because they are in the form of salts.

Soils with a high concentration of neutral salt (e.g., NaCl or
NaSO 4 ) are called saline. In cases where sodium is combined
with weak anions (such as HCO 3– ), alkaline soils develop,

which have a pH generally greater than 8.5. Soils with high
levels of neutral salts are a problem for plants due to osmotic
imbalances. Alkaline soils are a problem because of excess
OH [–] ions and difficulty in nutrient uptake and plant development. In some regions, saline–alkaline conditions occur
when both forms of salt are present. Proper irrigation and
soil water management become a key part of dealing with
these conditions.


**SOIL NUTRIENTS**


Since plants obtain their nutrients from the soil, the supply of
nutrients in the soil becomes a major determinant of an agroecosystem’s productivity. Many nutrient analysis methodologies have been developed for determining the levels of various
nutrients in the soil. When a particular nutrient is not present
in sufficient quantity, it is called a **limiting nutrient** and must
be added. Fertilization technologies have grown and evolved
to meet this need. It must be kept in mind, however, that the
presence of a nutrient does not necessarily mean it is _avail-_
_able_ to plants. A variety of factors—including pH, CEC, and
soil texture—determine the actual availability of nutrients.

Because of the loss or export of nutrients out of the soil
due to harvest, leaching, or volatilization, fertilizers must
continually be added in large amounts to most agroecosystems. But the cost of fertilizers as an input is increasing, and
leached fertilizer pollutes ground and surface water supplies;
therefore, an understanding of how nutrients can be cycled
more efficiently in agroecosystems becomes essential for
long-term sustainability.

As described in Chapter 2, the major plant nutrients are
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur.
Each of these nutrients is part of a different biogeochemical cycle and relates to management of soil in a unique way.
The management of carbon will be discussed below in terms
of organic matter; nitrogen in the soil will be included in a
discussion of mutualisms and the ecological role of nitrogenfixing bacteria and legumes in Chapter 17. Here, as an example of an important soil nutrient, we will examine the nutrient
phosphorus. Because the efficient recycling of phosphorus
depends principally on what happens in the soil, it can teach
us a lot about sustainable nutrient management.

Unlike carbon and nitrogen, whose principal reservoirs
are in the atmosphere, the principal reservoir of phosphorus is in the soil. It occurs naturally in the environment as a
form of phosphate. Phosphates can occur in the soil solution
as inorganic phosphate ions (especially as PO 43– ) or as part

of dissolved organic compounds. But the primary source of
phosphate is the weathering of parent material; therefore, the



Lost to ocean


sediments


**FIGURE** **8.4** **Pathways** **of** **phosphorus** **cycling** **in**
**agroecosystems.**


input of phosphorus into the soil and the phosphorus cycle in
agroecosystems is limited by the relatively slow rate of this
geologic process.

Inorganic soluble phosphate ions are absorbed by plant
roots and incorporated into plant biomass. The phosphorus in this biomass can be sent along one of three different
pathways, depending on how the biomass is consumed. As
shown in Figure 8.4, consumption of plant biomass by pest
herbivores, by grazing animals, or by humans who harvest
the biomass comprises the three pathways. Phosphorus in
the first pathway is returned to the soil as excreta, where it
decomposes and enters the soil solution. Phosphorus in the
second pathway can be recycled in the same way, but if the
grazing animal goes to market, some phosphorus goes with
it. In the third pathway, there is little chance of the phosphorus returning to the soil from which it was extracted (except
in a few places such as parts of rural of China, where human
excreta is used as fertilizer).

Much of the phosphorus consumed by humans in the
form of plant biomass or the flesh of grazing animals is
essentially lost from the system. An example of what may
happen to phosphorus in the third (human consumption)
pathway may serve to illustrate the problem: phosphate is
mined from phosphate-rich marine deposits that have been
geologically uplifted and exposed in Florida, processed into
soluble fertilizer or crushed into rock powder, and shipped
to farms in Iowa where it is applied to the soil for the production of soybeans. A part of the phosphorus, in the form
of phosphates, is taken up by the plant and sequestered in
the beans that are harvested and sent to California, where
they are turned into tofu. Following consumption of the
tofu, most of the liberated phosphate finds its way into local


**96** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems



sewer systems, and eventually ends up returning to the sea
3000 miles from where it originated. Since the time necessary to build up sufficient sediments of phosphate-rich
rock and to go through the geological process of uplifting
is very much beyond the realm of the human time frame,
and since the known easily available phosphate reserves are
quite limited, current practices of phosphate fertilizer management in many modern agroecosystems can be said to be
unsustainable.


For sustainable management of phosphorus to occur,
phosphate needs to pass quickly through the soil component of the cycle and back to plants for it not to be fixed in
sediments or washed to sea. Ways must be found to better
keep phosphorus in an organic form, either in standing biomass or in SOM, and to ensure that as soon as phosphorus is



liberated from this organic form, it is quickly reabsorbed by
soil microorganisms or plant roots.

An additional component of sustainable management of
soil phosphorus has to do with the formation of insoluble
phosphorus compounds in the soil. Phosphates in the soil
solution often react chemically (especially with iron and aluminum) to form insoluble compounds, or become trapped in
clay micelles out of reach of most biological recovery. Low
pH in the soil exacerbates the problem of phosphate fixation
in an insoluble form. At the same time, however, these processes provide a strong mechanism for retaining phosphorus
in the soils of the agroecosystem; phosphate fertilizers added
to the soil are retained almost completely. Some agricultural
soils in California show very high levels of total (though
not easily available) phosphorus after several decades of



**SPECIAL TOPIC: WILL WE RUN OUT OF PHOSPHORUS?**

The spectacular increases in global food production and agricultural yields that began after World War II are usually
credited to farmers’ rapid adoption of “Green Revolution” technologies such as pesticides, hybrid varieties, and inorganic
fertilizers. The fertilizer part of this story often singles out the nitrogen component, highlighting humankind’s newfound
ability to literally create out of thin air industrial quantities of what is generally the most limiting plant nutrient in soils
worldwide.


Phosphorus gets less attention, but in most respects this element is equally responsible for the food production boom
of the latter half of the twentieth century. Phosphorus is so critical to plant growth and generally limited enough in its
concentration in the soil that adding it to fields, along with fixed nitrogen, was an easy way of boosting productivity. And
once farming systems became enmeshed in the high-external-input regime and ended practices that recycled phosphorus,
it was necessary to continue adding phosphorus, along with fixed nitrogen, to maintain high levels of productivity. As
a result, much of agriculture worldwide is today absolutely dependent on their being relatively cheap, readily available
sources of phosphorus for making fertilizer.

For the time being, phosphorus is indeed abundant and relatively inexpensive. Global production stands at about
160 billion metric tons/year, and no production shortfalls are forecast despite expected increases in demand. However,
there is mounting concern about the longer-term future of phosphorus supplies. The core problem is that phosphorus is
very different from nitrogen. As discussed in this chapter, while nitrogen exists in an enormous atmospheric reservoir,
phosphorus exists only in mineral form. Phosphorus in any reasonably concentrated form can be obtained only by mining deposits of rock phosphate that were formed over the course of millions of years. In this sense, phosphorus is not a
renewable resource. At some point in the future, humans will have used up the last adequately concentrated, accessible
deposits of phosphorus.

Much debate, discussion, and research have focused on when the supplies of phosphorus will begin to run short.
Despite all this attention, there is little agreement about the timing, with credible estimates running from before the
middle of this century to some 300 years from now. From the standpoint of sustainability, however, the debate about
“peak phosphorus” is beside the point and may only serve to divert attention away from a more fundamental issue: that
the global food system, of which phosphate mining and inorganic fertilizer production are major parts, is unsustainable
for a multitude of other reasons as well. If we hope to put food production on a sustainable footing, our reliance on mined
rock phosphate must end well before shortages of rock phosphate become an issue.

The alternative approach to phosphorus management—using practices that return phosphorus to the soil and increase
its available content in the soil by building up organic matter—is much more conducive to agroecosystem health and
carries with it a host of other benefits, as noted in this chapter. Returning the phosphorus contained in human and animal
excreta (and, to a lesser extent, in crop residue) to the soil has the added benefit of keeping phosphorus out of streams,
lakes, and estuaries, where it causes eutrophication. Reducing inputs of mined phosphorus also prevents accumulation of
cadmium (most rock phosphate contains some cadmium), reduces the consumption of fossil fuels required to extract, process, and ship the mined phosphate, and reduces the risk inherent in relying on only six countries in the world (Morocco,
China, Algeria, Syria, South Africa, and Jordan) for the supply of an element critical for food production. Rather than
thinking that we can keep up business as usual for at least a few more decades because phosphorus reserves are still large,
we should be rethinking how we can begin managing this crucial nutrient more sensibly today.


Soil **97**



farming. So leakage of phosphorus from agroecosystems can
be quite small, but the unavailability of phosphorus from the
soil component of the system once it is fixed requires further addition of available phosphorus in the form of fertilizer.
Of course, biological means of liberating this “stored” phosphorus might contribute better to sustainability. These means
have a lot to do with the management of SOM.


**SOIL ORGANIC MATTER AND SOIL BIOTA**


The texture of the soil, its vertical layering, its chemical and
physical characteristics, and its nutrient content are all of great
importance agriculturally. Ultimately, however, what matters
most about soil is its ability to function as a living part of the
agroecosystem as a whole. In this context, the word _living_ is
used quite literally. Soil is a living part of the agroecosystem
when it contains and supports a diverse assortment of living organisms. These organisms, collectively called the **soil**
**biota**, in turn depend on the organic matter in the soil as the
basis of their nutrition.


Soil biota and SOM are important agriculturally for two
main reasons. First, they are primary determinants of soil
fertility, causing beneficial changes in soil structure and
determining the availability of nutrients. Second, they are
more readily manipulable—subject to improvement through
management—than the inorganic components of the soil. If
the soil in a field is a clayey loam high in calcium, it will
likely always have those characteristics. But by properly
managing the SOM—and through that the soil biota—the
farmer can make the difference between a poor and fragile
soil and a fertile, robust soil.


**N** **onliving** **S** **oil** **O** **rganic** **M** **atter**


**Soil organic matter** is comprised of diverse, heterogeneous
components. It includes surface litter, dead roots, plant residue in various stages of decomposition, microbial metabolites, humic substances, and the excreta of animals living in
or passing over the soil. In natural ecosystems, the organic
matter content of the A horizon can range up to 15% or
20% or more, but in most soils it averages 1%–5%. In the
absence of human intervention, organic matter content of
the soil depends mostly on climate and vegetative cover;
generally, more organic matter is found under the conditions of cool and moist climates. We also know that there

is a very close correlation between the amount of organic
matter in the soil and both carbon and nitrogen content.
A close estimate of SOM content can be obtained by multiplying either total carbon content by 2 or total nitrogen
content by 20.

During its life in the soil, organic matter plays many very
important roles, all of which are of importance to sustainable agriculture (see reviews by Magdoff and Weil 2004;
Uphoff et al. 2006; and Cheeke et al. 2012). Organic matter
builds, promotes, protects, and maintains the soil ecosystem. As we have already discussed, SOM is a key component of good soil structure, increases water and nutrient



retention, and provides important mechanical protection of
the soil surface. Perhaps its most important function, however, is to serve as the food source—the base of the soil food
pyramid—for soil biota.

In contrast to the undisturbed soil of seminatural eco
systems, intensively managed agricultural soil often has
very little organic matter. The tendency of the practices of
industrial agriculture to reduce SOM content over time may,
indeed, be considered one of its most harmful consequences.
Fortunately, it is possible to increase SOM—and even restore
to healthy levels the organic matter in depleted soils—
through a variety of practices.


**S** **oil** **B** **iota**


The organisms that inhabit the soil range from the tiniest
cyanobacteria to relatively large invertebrates. Because size
is related to ecological role, members of the soil biota are
often categorized by size. The macrofauna are arthropods
like myriapods (centipedes and millipedes) and earthworms
large enough to be measured in centimeters. The mesofauna
are mostly tiny arthropods like collembola and mites that
are measured in millimeters. The microfauna are made up
of a wide variety of protozoans and nematodes measured
in micrometers. Finally, there are the microflora, a diverse
collection of bacteria and fungi, which obtain their nutrition
not by ingesting other organisms but instead by breaking the
chemical bonds in organic matter and harvesting the energy
that is released. Plant roots are also part of the soil biota, and
may be considered the soil’s “macroflora”.

The members of the soil biota—especially the
microflora—are poorly known. Only a small percentage
of the estimated millions of species have been described.
Although their total mass in the soil is small compared to
the mass of SOM, the number of individuals can be astounding. In healthy agricultural soil, there are as many as one billion bacteria and thousands of protozoa inhabiting a gram of
soil—about a teaspoon. And if all the fungal hyphae in that
same gram of soil were arranged in a single long strand, it
would be several meters in length.

The many different organisms that make up the soil biota
interact in a complex food web. The microflora feed on plant
residues, obtaining energy by oxidizing the organic molecules that make up this once-living organic matter (which
is another way of saying they accomplish the process of
decomposition). The members of the microfauna feed on
these microflora species, and are in turn preyed upon by
the larger mesofauna. Some macrofauna are predators on
the mesofauna; others, like earthworms, eat plant residues.
Through the interactions in this food web, energy and matter
are cycled and transformed.

cropping systems that yield harvestable biomass year after
year without large quantities of external inputs.


  - By breaking down plant and animal residue into

their most basic constituents, soil organisms are
key linkages in the earth’s biogeochemical cycles—
those involving phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium,
sulfur, carbon, and oxygen.

  - In their own bodies and in the relatively stable

humic substances they create, soil microbes sequester very large quantities of carbon.

  - Plant debris and dead organisms contain large

amounts of plant nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, but these nutrients are unavailable to plants until they are released from organic
matter by the action of soil biota.

  - As they feed on organic matter, soil microbes pro
duce sticky, gumlike mucilages that hold together
soil particles and thus contribute to the tilth, or
crumb structure of the soil.

  - Due to its colloidal nature, the humus produced by

soil microbes greatly increases the CEC of the soil.
Loosely bound to humic substances, nutrient ions
are resistant to leaching by rainfall or irrigation, but
nevertheless available to plant roots. Humus also
greatly increases the water holding capacity of soil.

 - Many soil organisms directly promote plant

growth. One way they do this is by forming mutualistic associations with plant roots and providing
the plants with nutrients (e.g., _Rhizobium_ bacteria
fix atmospheric nitrogen and make it available to
plants, and mycorrhizae greatly increase nutrient
take-up by root hairs). Some soil microbes may
also release growth-promoting compounds into
the soil.

  - When they have large amounts of SOM on which

to feed, some soil microbes can outcompete and
directly suppress plant pathogens.

  - Soil microbes degrade organic pollutants—
including petroleum hydrocarbons, chlorinated
solvents, and pharmaceuticals—reducing or eliminating their toxicity.


Clearly, it is in the interests of the farmer or agroecosystem
manager to maximize SOM and to enhance the health and
diversity of the soil biota. The next section discusses some of
the means by which this can be accomplished.


**SOIL MANAGEMENT**


In present-day farming systems, soil is treated as if it were
mainly a medium for holding the plant up. When soil is managed for sustainable production and emphasis is placed on
the role of SOM and soil biota, however, the role of soil is
greatly expanded.

Many farmers feel that if a high yield is obtained from the
land, then this is evidence of a productive soil. However, if



the perspective is agroecological and the goal is to maintain
and promote all of the soil-forming and soil-protecting processes involving organic matter and soil biota, then a productive soil is not necessarily a fertile soil. The processes in the
soil that enable us to produce a crop take on greater importance in sustainable agriculture. Fertilizers can be added to
raise production, but only through an understanding of nutrient cycles and soil ecological processes—especially SOM
and soil biota dynamics—can soil fertility be maintained or
restored.


Many farmers striving for sustainability have focused
their soil management on the goal of increasing or maintaining the organic matter content of their soil. To the extent
that they consider the soil biota, they understand that keeping SOM at relatively high levels is beneficial to soil organisms. Increasing recognition of the importance of soil biota,
however, argues for inverting this approach: make enhancement of the diversity, function, and abundance of the soil
biota the primary goal, and think of increasing the inputs
of organic matter as one of the primary means of realizing
this goal.

In addition to increasing organic matter inputs, two other
means of enhancing the soil biota have been shown to be
effective: reducing the intensity of tillage and diversifying
cropping systems (Stockdale and Watson 2012). All three
strategies, especially when used together, have the effect of
mitigating the potential negative impacts of agriculture on
both the soil biota and SOM.


**I** **ncreasing** **O** **rganic** **M** **atter** **I** **nputs**


Once a soil is put under cultivation, the original organic matter levels begin to decline unless specific steps are taken to
maintain them. After an initial rapid decline, the decrease
slows. Several kinds of changes occur in the soil as a consequence of the loss of organic matter. Crumb structure is
lost, bulk density begins to rise, soil porosity suffers, and—
because SOM is the basis of the soil food web—biological
activity declines. Soil compaction and the development of a
hardened soil layer at the average depth of cultivation, called
a plow pan, can become problems as well.

The extent to which organic content declines in soil under
cultivation is dependent on the crop and cropping practices.
Some examples follow.

In one study, the organic matter contents of the upper
25 cm of soil in two agroecosystems used for intensive vegetable production in coastal central California were compared
with each other and to an unfarmed grassland control. One
system had been farmed for 25 years using organic farming
practices and the other for 40 years under conventional practices. The study showed that the organic matter content had
been reduced from 9.869 to 8.705 kg/m [3] in the organic system and to 9.088 kg/m [3] in the conventional system (Waldon
1994). Even with the higher inputs of organic matter in the
form of composts and winter covercrops in the organic system, intensive cultivation and cropping significantly reduced
SOM even more than in the conventional system.


Soil **99**


In another study, in which corn and soybean production
systems were compared side by side over a 30-year period
at the Rodale Institute in Kutztown, PA, it was shown that
organic management significantly improved important soil
health indicators, especially in comparison to synthetic
input-based conventional management. The soils of two different organic treatments had improved levels of SOM, more
active soil biota, better water retention, darker color, and
more stable soil aggregates, whereas the conventional soil
actually suffered a loss of SOM during the 30 years of study
(Rodale Institute 2012).



A study comparing soils after 75 years of organic and
conventional wheat production in eastern Washington found
that organic matter was not only maintained in the organic
system, but actually increased over time, while production
levels for the organic farmer were near equal to the conventional (Reganold et al. 1987). We can see from these three
examples that crop type, input management, local environment, and cultivation practices all help determine the longterm impacts of farming on SOM. Organic management per
se doesn’t necessarily lead to increases in SOM; it is necessary to set as a specific goal the enhancement of SOM and to
make management choices that help achieve this goal.

Since farming tends to deplete SOM, sources of new
organic matter must be continually added—at least enough
to replace that which is lost through harvest and decomposition. If the agroecosystem were more similar to a natural
ecosystem, a diversity of plant species would be present in
addition to the crop or crops being grown for harvest. Many
agroforestry systems in tropical regions, for example (see
Chapter 18) have a large number of plants, many of them
noncrop species, whose primary role is biomass production
and the return of organic matter to the soil. While farmers
all over the world have much to learn from such systems,
most are forced by practical and environmental reasons to
manage systems that are significantly less diverse. They
must therefore find ways of adding organic matter to their
systems instead of counting on plants in the systems to do it
themselves.


There are a variety of sources of organic matter inputs;
some of the most common are discussed below. While the

total volume of organic matter added to (or returned to) the
soil is the primary consideration, another important factor is
the nature of the organic matter itself. Organic matter inputs
vary considerably in their carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios,
in their decomposability, in their effect on soil pH, and in
various other ways. Since different kinds of organic matter
inputs may have different impacts on the soil biota, it may be
advantageous to diversify the types of organic matter added
to a cropping system.


**Crop Residue**
An important source of organic matter is crop residue. Many
farmers are experimenting with better ways of returning to
the soil the parts of the crop that are not destined for human
or animal use. A major concern has been how to deal with
potential pest or disease organisms that residue may harbor



**FIGURE** **8.5** **Burning of crop residue in Taiwan.** Burning is
a common method of removing crop residue. Although it returns
some nutrients to the soil and helps control pests and diseases,
burning can cause significant air pollution and prevents crop residue from being incorporated into the soil as organic matter. When
crop residue is seen as a valuable and useful resource for maintaining SOM, techniques for incorporating it into the soil can be developed as alternatives to burning.


and pass on to a subsequent crop. Proper timing of incorporation of the residue into the soil, rotating crops, and composting the residue away from the field and then returning
the finished compost are possible ways of overcoming this
problem. Research on these and other management strategies are helping transform crop residue from a problematic
by-product into a valuable part of SOM management (Unger
1994; Uphoff et al. 2006) (Figure 8.5).


**Covercrops**
Covercropping, where a plant cover is grown specifically to
produce plant matter for incorporation as a “green manure”
into the soil, is another important source of organic matter.
Covercrop plants are usually grown in rotation with a crop or
during a time of the year that the crop can’t be grown. When
legumes are used as covercrops, either alone or in combination with nonlegume species, the quality of the biomass can
be greatly improved. The resultant biomass can be incorporated into the soil, or left on the surface as a protective mulch
until it decomposes.

In a research done at the University of California (UC)
Santa Cruz (Gliessman 1987), a local variety of fava bean
called bellbean ( _Vicia faba_ ) was grown as a covercrop in
combination with either cereal rye or barley during the winter wet-season fallow period. It was shown that the total dry
matter produced in the grass/legume mixtures was almost
double that of the legume alone. After 3 years of covercrop
use, organic matter levels in soils under mixed covers
improved as much as 8.8%. Interestingly, soils under the
legume-only cover actually dropped slightly in organic matter content after 3 years, probably because the lower C/N
ratio of the incorporated organic matter caused more rapid
microbial breakdown.


**100** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems


A more recent innovation in the covercropping approach is
the use of a living mulch, where a noncrop species is planted
between the rows of the crop during the cropping cycle.
Living mulches have become especially popular in vineyard,
orchard, and tree crop systems. Research has focused on
ways of minimizing negative interactions between covercrop
and crop species, especially living mulches in annual crops.
Studies are also finding that living mulches can provide and
conserve nitrogen for grain crops, reduce soil erosion, reduce
weed pressure, and increase SOM content (Hartwig and
Ammon 2002).



**Manure**

It is a long-standing practice, both in conventional and alternative farming systems, to add animal manures to the soil to
improve organic matter content. The application of animal
manure is an important tool for an integrated nutrient management strategy because applications can simultaneously
increase SOM and supply nutrients for crop growth (Seiter
and Horwath 2004; Organic Trade Association 2011). Dairies
and feedlot operations produce large amounts of animal
wastes that are converted to a useful resource when returned
to fields, but as we have already noted in Chapter 1, there are
many problems involved in containing, storing, transporting, and applying such large quantities of animal manures.
Small, integrated farm operations can more easily use animal manures that accumulate in stables or pens for intensive
vegetable production or use on other crops (see Chapter 19).
The use of silkworm droppings in Chinese agriculture is yet
another example of the use of animal manures.

At any scale, the direct application of animal manures
can have many drawbacks, however. Smell and flies are often
associated with direct manure application. Nitrogen loss
through ammonification can be quite high. Runoff of nitrates
and other soluble materials can be a problem. And once fresh
manures are incorporated into the soil, there often is a waiting period for decomposition and stabilization before planting
can take place. To avoid these problems, current organic certification standards in the United States require that fresh or
raw animal manures be composted under specific conditions
before they are applied (Organic Trade Association 2011)
(Figure 8.6).


**Composts**
Compost amendment of soil is an attractive way to add
organic matter for a variety of reasons. The particle size
distribution of compost favors uniform field application; the
ratio of carbon to nitrogen is optimal; compost is usually
free of weed seeds; and soil diseases are often suppressed by
compost addition (Chen et al. 2004; Hitchings 2009). Many
different sources of organic materials, from manures to agricultural by-products to lawn clippings, are being converted
into useful soil amendments through the composting process.
Under controlled conditions, raw organic matter goes through
the first stages of decomposition and humification, so that
when it is added to the soil, it has stabilized considerably and
can contribute more effectively to the soil fertility-building

process. In this way, wastes—including materials that would
otherwise go to already bulging landfills—are being converted into resources (Figure 8.7).

Vermicompost, or compost produced through the action
of worms, is also becoming a popular source of SOM, especially for smaller-scale farm and garden systems. Fresh, wet
organic matter, especially food waste, is consumed by worms
specifically known for their composting ability (red worms
such as _Eisenia fetida_ are especially good), and systems
have been developed where a small household vermicomposting chamber can produce up to 25 kg of worm castings
a month. These castings are known for their high levels of
phosphate, nitrogen, and other nutrients, and also contain
polysaccharides that glue soil particles together and aid in
SOM development. Cuban researchers have recently developed farm-scale vermicomposting systems that are designed
to replace difficult-to-obtain imported fertilizers. Further
development of larger-scale systems could aid greatly in
improved soil management.


Soil **101**


the world do not separate human from industrial wastes, contaminating the resultant sludge with toxic amounts of heavy
metals, complicates the process immensely.

Nevertheless, sewage will undoubtedly become a more
important resource in the future as a source of organic matter, nutrients, and water for crop production. Many smallscale and traditional practices for turning sewage into a
useful resource can serve as an important basis for future
research on this important link to sustainability.

**Other Soil Amendments**

A range of other types of organic soil amendments can be
used as well. Humates, kelp, fish meal, animal by-products,
mined guano, and others are on the market. Each one has
specific applications, advantages and disadvantages, and
optimal scales of use. Each organic matter source needs to
be examined for short-term crop response, but more importantly for possible long-term contributions to SOM development and maintenance.

a few parts of the world—is sewage. To complete nutrient
cycles, nutrients that leave the farm should ultimately come
back to the farm. If they can come back in an organic form,
then they will also add to the soil-building process.

Solid material removed from wastewater during treatment, known as sewage sludge, has been spread on the land
for decades. As a percentage of dry weight, sewage sludge
can contain 6%–9% nitrogen, 3%–7% phosphorus, and up
to 1% potassium. It can be applied as dried cake or granules,
with a water content of 40%–70%, or as a liquid slurry that is
80%–90% water. Sewage sludge is widely used on turf grass,
degraded range land, and even on the ground below fruit
trees. The liquid portion of treated sewage, known as effluent, has been applied to land for a long time in Europe and
selected sites in the United States. Some cities operate what
are called sewage farms where effluent is used to produce
crops, usually animal feeds and forages, that partially offset
the cost of disposal, while in other cases it is used for irrigating golf courses, highway landscaping, and even forests.

There is much to learn, however, about how to treat sewage so that pathogens are dealt with properly. Collection,
treatment, and transport all need to be examined with an eye
toward the goal of linking waste management with sustainable agriculture. The fact that many sewage systems around



The conventional wisdom in agriculture is that soil must be
cultivated to control weeds, incorporate organic matter, and
allow root growth. Despite its potential benefits, however,
cultivation can degrade soil structure, reduce organic matter content, disrupt soil biota, simplify the soil food web,
and cause the soil to lose some of the elements of productivity. For these reasons, paying attention to how the soil is
cultivated must be an integral part of managing soil biota
and SOM.


Many different patterns of soil tillage exist, but the main
pattern employed in conventional agriculture is a three-stage
process involving a deep plowing that turns the soil, a secondary tilling for preparation of a seed bed, and finally postplanting cultivations (often combined with herbicide use) for
controlling weeds. Soil erosion, loss of good soil structure,
and nutrient leaching are well-known problems associated
with this pattern of tillage. Despite these problems, most
conventional farming systems, especially those producing
annual grains and vegetables, are dependent on extensive and
repeated tillage.

At the other extreme, there are many traditional farming
systems in which no tillage is used at all. In swidden agriculture, traditional farmers clear land using slash and burn
techniques and then poke the soil with a planting stick to sow
seeds. Such systems, which have the longest history of sustained management, respect the need for a fallow period to
control weedy vegetation and to allow natural soil-building
processes to replace removed nutrients. Many agroforestry
systems, such as coffee or cacao under shade, depend on the
tree component of the system to provide soil cover and nutrient cycling, and only receive occasional surface weeding.
Permanent pasture is rarely cultivated either.

Alternative tillage techniques, many of them borrowed
from traditional farming practices, have been developed for
and tested in conventional annual crop systems. These have
demonstrated that annual crop systems do not have to remain
dependent on extensive and repeated tillage and that reduced
tillage can help improve soil quality and fertility (El Titi
2002; Magdoff and Van Es 2009).

Using the technique of **zero tillage**, soil cultivation is limited to the actual seedbed and is done at the time of seed

planting. In some cases, special equipment is used that allows
planting directly into the crop residue left from the previous
crop. Other steps, such as fertilization and weed control, can
be completed at the same time as planting. Unfortunately,

and diversity of soil organisms. Thus, the farmer seeking to
enhance the health of the soil ecosystem would do well to
consider diversifying his or her operations spatially (through
polyculture, alley cropping, agroforestry, and other techniques) and temporally (through rotations). As we will see in
Section IV, cropping system diversification has a variety of
other benefits as well.



**FIGURE** **8.8** **One of the custom-made tillers used for cultiva-**

**tion of the ridge-till systems on the Thompson Farm in Boone,**
**Iowa.** The tiller is completing the first cultivation pass after planting of the corn crop, in which soil on the shoulders of the ridges is
cut away (killing weeds) and then pushed back. Dick Thompson
pioneered the ridge-till system in the 1980s, after recognizing that
even though conventional cultivation killed weeds, it also created
the ideal disturbed environment for their regrowth. Over the years,
thousands of farmers and researchers visited the Thompson Farm
to learn from the acknowledged “expert” on ridge-till systems.


many zero tillage systems have developed a great dependence
on herbicides, which may create other ecological problems.

In order to reduce or eliminate herbicide use, a number of
**reduced-tillage** systems have been developed. One in particular that has been quite successful for the production of corn,
soybean, and other crops is **ridge tillage** (see Figure 8.8).
After an initial plowing in which the planting beds, or ridges,
are formed, the only cultivation that occurs is focused on seed
planting, weed management, incorporation of organic matter
(crop residue, covercrops, manure) into the tilled surface soil,
and movement of surface soil from ridgetop to valley or vice
versa. The specially designed tillers used for the cultivation
never penetrate deeply into the soil. Some ridge-till systems
can go through many years of repeated planting without deep
tillage, and the reduced soil disturbance helps preserve SOM
and soil structure, enhancing the abundance and diversity of
the soil biota. Further, in many systems, herbicides can be
eliminated completely because every step in the process is
focused on minimizing opportunities for weed germination
and growth.

The diversity of the aboveground agroecosystem is directly
linked to the diversity of the belowground ecosystem. When
there are more types of crop plants, there is greater diversity in leaf litter, plant exudates, and rooting patterns; this
diversity creates a greater number of habitats belowground,
and a wider range of environmental conditions, which promote greater species richness in the soil biota. Conversely,
the monocultures that characterize the industrial approach to
agriculture have been shown to greatly reduce the abundance



Agroecosystem diversity at a landscape level can also
benefit soil biota. Field margins, hedgerows, riparian corridors, and patches of unfarmed land can serve as reservoirs
of soil biota diversity. When these reservoirs are present
on the landscape, it is more likely that species of soil biota
extinguished from farmed land can recolonize fields when
management practices are changed to make the fields more
congenial to the full range of soil organisms present in a particular region.

When soil is understood to be a living, dynamic system—
an ecosystem—management for sustainability becomes an
integrated, whole-system process. Focusing on the processes
that promote the maintenance of a healthy, dynamic, and productive system becomes paramount. Fertility management is
based on our understanding of nutrient cycles, organic matter
content, and the abundance and diversity of the soil biota.
The application of our understanding of the ecological processes that maintain the structure and function of the soil

ecosystem over time takes on the greatest importance. And
since the soil ecosystem is a complex, dynamic, and everchanging set of components and processes, our understanding of this complexity must increase.

Good soil management is an important part of attaining
overall sustainability of agroecosystems. Many of the indicators of sustainability discussed in Chapter 22 relate directly
to soil.


**FOOD FOR THOUGHT**


1. Organic matter is considered to be one of the most

important components of a healthy soil ecosystem,
but most agricultural activities (i.e., plowing, burning, cultivation, harvest) remove, reduce, or degrade
organic matter. What are some of the most practical ways of maintaining this valuable resource in
the soil?

2. What are the key factors that determine how long a

degraded soil will take to be restored to a condition
similar to its previous healthy condition?
3. What is the difference between dirt and soil?

4. It has recently been proposed that we develop some

indicators of “soil health” in order to determine the

sustainability of different farming practices. What
indicators do you think should be used to evaluate
the health of the soil?

5. Why is it important for farmers to learn how to use

the concept of the soil ecosystem?
