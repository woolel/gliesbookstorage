## chapter 14. Population Ecology of Agroecosystems

In agronomy and industrial agriculture, the center of attention is the population of organisms—whether crop plants or livestock—from which the product will be extracted. A farmer attempts to maximize the performance of this ­population by managing the various factors of the environmental complex. When sustainability of the entire agroecosystem becomes the primary concern, however, this narrow focus on the needs of one usually genetically homogenous population becomes wholly inadequate. The agroecosystem must be viewed as a collection of interacting populations of many kinds of organisms, including noncrop species, animals, and microorganisms.

Consideration of the agroecosystem as a collection of interacting populations involves several levels of study. First, we require the conceptual tools necessary to understand and compare how each population goes about surviving and reproducing itself in the environment of the agroecosystem. These tools and their application are the subject of this chapter. Second, we need to look at the genetic basis of crop populations and how the manipulation of this genetic potential by humans has affected crop plants’ adaptability and range of tolerance. We will turn our attention to this topic in Chapter 15. Finally, we need to consider the community and ecosystem-level processes of interacting populations, which will be explored in Chapters 16 through 19.

**PRINCIPLES OF POPULATION ECOLOGY**

**AND PLANT DEMOGRAPHY**

The single-species population has long been the main subject of agronomic research. Crop breeders adjust the genetic potential of crop populations, and production specialists develop management technologies that get the most out of that potential. This has led to a type of crop ecologist skilled at adjusting one factor of the system at a time or developing technologies that solve single problems, such as controlling a particular pest with a specific pesticide. But since the agroecosystem is made up of complex interactions between many populations of organisms, an agroecological approach requires a broader analysis. Studies of interactions between populations at the same trophic level must be carried out at the same time studies are going on that focus on the interactions between populations at different trophic levels. Integrated pest management, for example, requires a simultaneous analysis of the population ecology of each member of the specific crop–pest–natural enemy complex, as well as other populations of organisms with which the entire complex interacts. Ultimately, we must consider this

complex of populations as the entire crop community, a level of ecological analysis we will turn to in Chapter 16. But first, several basic principles of population ecology that help us understand the dynamics of each population will be discussed.

**P** **opulation** **G** **rowth**

Ecologists view population growth as the net result of birth rates, death rates, and the movement of individuals into and out of a particular population. Population growth is thus described by the formula

_r_ = ( _N_ + _I_ ) − ( _M_ + _E_ )

where _r_ is the intrinsic rate of population increase in a population over time, taking into account natality ( _N_ ), immigration ( _I_ ), mortality ( _M_ ), and emigration ( _E_ ). Any population changes over time are described by

_dP_ = _rP_ _dt_

where _P_ is the population under study over a specific time ( _t_ ) period. If resources do not become limiting, and negative interactions between members of the population do not reach some critical level as the population increases, a population would increase exponentially. Since this very simple equation does not take into account the effect of abiotic and biotic factors

of the environment on a population, nor the limits to growth that an environment can impose on a population, the following equation was developed to better model what happens in the real world:

_dP_ = _rP_ ⎛ _[K]_ − _P_ ⎞ _rP_ ⎛1 − _P_ ⎞ _dt_ ⎝ [⎜] _K_ ⎠ [⎟=] ⎝ [⎜] _K_ ⎠ [⎟]

The rate of growth of the population is unaffected by interference when _P_ approaches 0, and slows when _P_ approaches _K_ (the population size at the carrying capacity of the environment). This equation describes a logistic, sigmoidal, or S-shaped growth curve, as shown in Figure 14.1. The leveling off of the curve indicates that problems are eventually encountered in allocating resources to an expanding population. This curve could apply to a weed species in a crop field or a particular pest organism on the crop. Population increase is slow at first, begins to accelerate until it reaches a maximum rate of increase, and then slows as density increases.

**FIGURE 14.1** **The population growth curve.** This graph shows the theoretical rate of increase of a population over time. In this case, carrying capacity ( _K_ ) is reached at a population size of 500.

When the carrying capacity of the environment is reached, the curve levels off, and in many cases, will begin to drop if impact on the environment has created conditions that affect the entire population.

In natural ecosystems, complex feedback mechanisms can slow population increase before carrying capacity is reached, buffering the species against population crashes. Sometimes these mechanisms are directly determined by the number of individuals already present—in which case they are **den-** **sity dependent** . An example is competition for a limited resource. In other cases, the mechanism is due more to some external factor of the environment, such as a frost or flood, and is therefore **density independent** . In cropping systems, humans have devised different interventions and technolo gies that allow a crop population to increase in number or develop beyond the normal carrying capacity of that environment. Usually these interventions are associated with intensive habitat modification or inputs, and can include the control or elimination of other species (both plant and animal) and the use of fertilizers and irrigation.

**C** **olonization** **of** **N** **ew** **A** **reas**

The study of population growth is concerned mainly with the potential of a population to increase in size over time. It is incomplete, however, without attention being paid to the potential of a population to increase in area—that is, to colonize new habitats. The process of colonizing new areas is especially important to the agroecologist, who is concerned with how organisms besides crop plants—both beneficial and not—invade a field and establish populations there.

**Stages of Colonization** The manner in which a weed or animal pest colonizes a field is related to its life cycle. The initial invasion is accomplished as part of the species’ reproduction and dispersal process; the establishment of the population is dependent on the requirements of its seeds and seedlings or eggs and juveniles; whether the population remains in the area over time

is a function of how it grows, matures, and reproduces. Each of the stages in a species’ life history offers specific opportunities for intervention on the part of the farmer—either to encourage the colonization of a desired species or to restrict that of an unwanted one. In the succeeding text, the colonization process is divided into four stages, based on the life stages of the colonizing organisms: dispersal, establishment, growth, and reproduction. For the sake of clarity, these stages are discussed mostly in terms of plants.

_Dispersal_

The dispersion of organisms is an important phenomenon in natural ecosystems, and has some interesting applications to agroecology. Dispersal allows progeny to “escape” the vicinity of the mother organism, lessening the potential for intraspecific interference from an overpopulation of ecologically very similar siblings. It also allows a species to reach new habitats.

In agriculture, dispersal is important because of the continual disturbance of fields. This disturbance—whether wholesale in the case of conventional tillage or piecemeal in the case of perennial/annual polycultures such as those in tropical home gardens—continually creates new habitats available for colonization. Although many organisms maintain resident populations in a field despite their disturbance and manipulation, many noncrop organisms—including beneficial and detrimental weeds, insects, other animals, diseases, and microorganisms—all arrive in the field through dispersal. In this context, ecological barriers to dispersal take on important significance. Barriers may be as simple as a weedy border around a field, or a border made up of a different crop plant. In general, a more in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of the dispersal of noncrop organisms, and how they are affected by barriers, can become important in the design and management of the agroecosystem.

How plants and animals get from one place to another during the dispersal stages of their life cycles depends on the mechanisms they each have for dispersing themselves. These mechanisms are quite variable, but most often involve wind, animals, water, or gravity. Research on the long-distance dispersal of plants and animals has given us much insight into what these mechanisms are and how they work.

One of the foundational works on dispersal is Carlquist’s (1965) _Island Life_ . He reviews the natural history of islands of the world, discussing how animals and plants reach islands that either have had a physical connection to an adjacent mainland colonizing source or that have never had such a link. Similarly, Van der Pijl’s (1972) classic work on the _Principles of Dispersal in Higher Plants_ goes into great detail on the incredible diversity of mechanisms that aid seeds in moving from one place to another. These mechanisms can move an organism only a short distance, or great distances across amazing barriers of ocean or desert. They can also get a weed seed to a new field.

An important aspect of dispersal mechanisms is how many of them seem to provide a selective advantage for “getting away” from the source of reproduction. This is illustrated by field studies done on the distribution of seedlings

around “mother trees” in the forests of Costa Rica. As shown

in Figure 14.2, most of the newly germinated seeds and very young seedlings were concentrated close to the tree, but the older saplings (with potential for becoming adult, reproductive individuals) were found at a greater distance. Some intraspecific mechanism (e.g., competition, allelopathy) seems to eliminate seedlings from near the tree, and does not function at a greater distance. It is interesting to consider why there is advantage in establishing at some distance from the parent, especially in relation to resource availability, potential competition, and susceptibility to predation or disease.

Plant seeds are incorporated into the soil soon after they fall onto the soil surface, with the largest numbers found in the upper layers of soil. The population of each species of seed combines with others to form the **seed bank** . In cropping systems, the analysis of the weed seed bank can tell us a great deal about the prior history of management of a site and the potential problems that weeds may pose; this information can be important for designing appropriate management.

Since most crop organisms are dependent on humans for dispersal, their adaptations for dispersal have become irrelevant for the most part. Indeed, most crop species have lost the dispersal mechanisms they had as wild species. Their seeds have become too large or lost appendages that once facilitated dispersal, or their inflorescences no longer scatter seed. The loss of dispersal adaptations is seen particularly in annual crops, whose seed or grain is the portion of the crop that is harvested.

_Establishment_

There really is no bare area on the earth that propagules of plants and animals cannot get to. The incredible diversity of dispersal mechanisms mentioned earlier makes sure of that. But once a propagule arrives at a new location, it most certainly can have problems getting established. Restricting our attention to plants, a dispersing seed cannot determine where it will land, so it is the condition of the site that determines if the propagule can establish. Seeds fall into

a very heterogeneous environment, and only a fraction of the sites encountered will meet the needs of the seed. Only those microsites that fulfill the needs of the seed—the “safe sites”—can support germination and establishment (see Chapter 12). The greater the number of a species’ seeds that land in safe sites, the greater the chance of that species establishing a viable population in the new habitat.

The seedling stage is generally known to be the most sensitive period in the life cycle of the plant, and is therefore a critical stage in the establishment of a new population. This is true for crop species, weeds, and plants in natural ecosystems. A dormant seed can tolerate very difficult environmental conditions, but once it germinates, the newly emerged seedling must grow or die. Any one of the many extremes of environmental conditions the seedling might face can eliminate it, including drought, frost, herbivory, and cultivation. Human intervention can help ensure the successful and uniform establishment of crop seedlings, but the variability of the environmental complex still makes this the most sensitive phase for most crop plant populations. Early juvenile stages of most animals show the same sensitivity to environmental stress.

_Growth and Maturation_

Once a seedling has successfully established, its main “goal” is continued growth. The environment in which a seedling is located and its genetic potential, combine to determine just how quickly it will grow. In natural ecosystems, environmental factors such as drought or competition for light generally limit the growth process at some phase of plants’ development. If these factors become too extreme, individuals in the population will die.

Plants generally grow fastest, as measured by net biomass accumulated over time, in the early stages of growth. Their rate of growth slows as maturation begins—more energy is allocated to maintenance and the production of reproductive organs than to the production of new plant tissue. Growth may also slow if the resources available for each member of the

population become limiting.

**164** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

The time period from germination to maturity can range from a matter of days for some annuals to several decades for some perennials. A species that matures quickly will colonize a new area differently than a species that matures slowly, and each will present different challenges for management.

_Reproduction_

Once the original colonizing individuals have reached maturity, they can reproduce. The extent to which they are successful determines whether the new population will remain in the area, how it will grow, and how it will affect populations of other species over the long run. Reproduction can take place asexually through vegetative reproduction or sexually through the production of seeds. Some species depend on the rapid early growth of the colonizing seed supply and strong early control of the environment to inhibit later colonizers, followed by abundant reproduction. Other species may allocate more resources to developing fewer but larger and more dominant individuals in the population, sacrificing the production of new seeds in the process but ensuring the success of the individuals that reach maturity.

**Factors Affecting Success of Colonization** At any stage in the colonizing process described earlier, some event or condition can occur that may eliminate a certain percentage of the population. For an invading plant species, part of this elimination occurs when only a fraction of the seeds find an appropriate safe site for germination. Another large percentage of the population is lost shortly after germination, especially if weather conditions are not ideal. At any time during the development of the juvenile plants, more loss can occur. The final outcome is often a very reduced number of mature adults that begin to reproduce. The attrition can be even more pronounced in the presence of human management, which can in some cases threaten the survival of a whole population or species.

For some species, especially long-lived perennials, attrition of individuals at early stages of colonization may be so complete that environmental conditions may all come together in a sequence that permits survival of seedlings only one or a few years out of many. Several oak species ( _Quercus_ spp.) in California, for example, show clusters of equal-aged individuals in populations that are separated by 40–200 years, indicating that opportunities for establishment of new population clusters occur very infrequently.

**L** **ife** **H** **istory** **S** **trategies**

Each species that is successful in a particular environment has a unique set of adaptations that allow it to maintain a population in that environment over time. These adaptations can be thought of as comprising a “strategy” for organizing the life cycle to insure reproduction and the continuation of a viable population. Across species, life history strategies can be classified into general types.

Two important ways of classifying life history strategies are discussed in the succeeding text. They help provide an

understanding of how the populations of specific organisms are able to grow in number or colonize new areas. They can also help explain the ecological role of each species in the agroecosystem, aiding greatly in the management of both crop and noncrop species.

_**r**_ **- and** _**K**_ **-Selection Theory** Plants and animals have a limited amount of energy to “spend” on maintenance, growth, and reproduction. Allocation of more energy to reproduction reduces the amount available for growth, and vice versa. Ecologists have used observed differences in the allocation of energy to growth or to reproduction to develop a classification system that defines two basic types of life history strategies at opposite ends of a continuum: _r_ -selection and _K_ -selection. This system is known as _r_ - and _K_ -selection theory (MacArthur 1962; Pianka 1970, 1978).

At one extreme, we find species that live in harsh or variable environments in which mortality is mostly determined by limiting environmental factors rather than the density of the population, and where natural selection favors genotypes with a high intrinsic growth value. Members of the populations of these species allocate more energy to reproduction and less to growth and maintenance once they are established. Members of such species are called **r-strategists** because environmental factors keep the growth of such populations on the most rapidly increasing point of the logistic curve (see Figure 14.1). Their population sizes are limited more by physical factors than by biotic factors.

At the other extreme, we find species that live in stable or predictable environments where mortality is more a function of density-dependent factors such as interference with individuals of other populations and where natural selection favors genotypes with the ability to avoid or tolerate interference. These organisms allocate more resources to vegetative or nonreproductive activities. Members of such species are called **K-strategists** because they maintain the densest populations when the population size is close to the carrying capacity ( _K_ ) of the environment. Their population sizes are limited more by biotic factors than by physical factors.

In general, _r_ -strategists are opportunists; they have the ability to colonize temporary or disturbed habitats where interference is minimal, can rapidly take advantage of resources when they are available, are usually short lived, allocate a large proportion of their biomass to reproduction, and occupy open habitats or early successional systems. In the plant kingdom, _r_ -strategists usually produce large numbers of easily dispersible seeds whereas _K_ -strategists are usually long-lived tolerators with a prolonged vegetative or growth stage and occur in natural ecosystems in the later stages of succession.

The categories of _r_ -selection and _K_ -selection, however, are not clearly delineated. Most organisms are not purely _r_ -selected or _K_ -selected, but display a life history strategy making use of traits from both strategies. Some trees, for example, have very long life spans but produce extremely large numbers of small seeds. Therefore, _r_ - and _K_ -selection theory has to be applied with caution in the understanding of population dynamics and the evolution of adaptations.

Population Ecology of Agroecosystems **165**

For this reason, it has fallen out of favor among ecologists studying natural systems, replaced by models focusing on the age-specific mortality of species (Reznick et al. 2002).

Even so, the concepts of _r_ - and _K_ -selection can be very useful in understanding population dynamics in agroecosystems because most agroecosystems undergo such regular and extensive disturbance. Most weeds, pathogens, and pest insects in agroecosystems fit very well the model of _r_ -selected species (Booth et al. 2010). They are opportunistic, easily dispersed, reproductively active organisms that can very rapidly find, occupy, and dominate habitats in the disturbed agricultural landscape. Interestingly, most of the crop plants that we depend upon today in the world for the production of most of our basic food materials can also be classified as _r_ -selected species. The largest proportion of their biomass is in the reproductive portion of the plant. This is especially true of all of the annual grains we consume. It is thought that these crop

plants were derived mainly from species that evolved in open, regularly disturbed habitats; their _r_ -selected ability to grow rapidly is what made them good candidates for domestication.

One reason that _r_ -selected weeds are a problem in cropping systems is that the crop plants themselves are also _r_ -selected, and the open, disturbed conditions under which the crop plants thrive are the same as those under which the weeds grow best. Annual cropping systems, or perennial cropping systems with frequent disturbance, are in a sense selecting for the very problems farmers spend so much time, energy, and money trying to stop or eliminate. From this perspective, it can be seen that _K_ -strategists might be able to play important roles in agroecosystems as crop species. Perennial crop systems place a premium on the health and development of the vegetative part of the plant, even in cases where it is the fruit that is harvested. Less disturbance is created in the process of farming, and fewer opportunities are created for weedy _r_ -strategists.

**SPECIAL TOPIC: DEVELOPING A PERENNIAL GRAIN CROP**

The grain crops that form the cornerstone of the American diet—wheat, corn, and rice—can all be considered _r_ -strategists. They are annuals that grow rapidly in the disturbed environment of a cultivated field and use a large portion of their energy producing reproductive structures. In the course of domestication, humans have if anything enhanced the _r_ -selected nature of these plants, creating varieties of grains that are highly productive but dependent on extensive external inputs and human intervention.

Researchers at The Land Institute (TLI) are concerned about the erosion and degradation of the soil that goes along with the frequent tilling and application of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers necessary in annual grain production. They are also concerned about off-farm impacts of annual grain crops such as nitrogen leaching, carbon emissions, and climate change. They are working on interesting solutions to these problems: breeding perennial grain crops and developing perennial intercrop systems (Cox et al. 2010; Culman et al. 2010; Crews 2013; Van Tassel and DeHaan 2013).

Unfortunately, developing a perennial grain productive enough for agriculture is not easy. Perennial plant species that produce edible carbohydrate-rich seeds (as opposed to fruits) do exist in nature; the problem is that they are _K_ -selected and devote a relatively small proportion of their energy to seed production. For example, the natural perennial cousins of our annual grain crops—wild prairie grasses—have large rhizomes in which the plant stores substantial food reserves. The rhizomes help the plant survive harsh winters and occasional droughts, and enable it to reproduce asexually as well. For these plants, reproduction by seed is not a high priority, energetically speaking. But researchers at TLI have found that these perennial grasses do have an advantage over annual grains that might be exploitable: the total biomass, or NPP, of the perennial grasses is substantially greater per individual plant than annual grains when grown under similar water and nutrient conditions. This appears to be due to a perennial’s ability to capture more sunlight throughout the year.

TLI researchers are attempting to breed new grain crops that will maintain the rhizome and at the same time reallocate some of the extra photosynthate to seeds to make harvest worthwhile (Van Tassel et al. 2010). Although the biomass of the seeds would represent a smaller “slice” of the plant’s biomass “pie” than is the case with annual grains, the fact that the pie is much larger means that the goal is biologically realistic. But understanding the genetics of seed production, biomass allocation, and ecological adaptations makes for a very complicated breeding challenge.

There would be many ecological benefits from growing such plants extensively. In particular, they would help prevent soil erosion, a critical problem for annual grain crops. The soil would not have to be tilled each season, and the plants’ larger root systems would effectively hold soil in place. The larger root systems would also be more effective than those of annual grains in capturing nitrogen, reducing the need for fertilizer inputs each year and making it possible to meet the plants’ needs for N entirely through biological fixation.

The researchers originally surveyed more than 4000 perennial species for their potential to produce a grain crop, and have focused their research on the most promising candidates for domestication. The main two lines being worked on at this time are “kernza” or intermediate wheatgrass ( _Thinopyrum intermedium_ ) and several oilseed species in the sunflower family ( _Silphium integrifolium_, _Helianthus maximiliani_, and _Helianthus rigidus_ ). Another avenue of research involves creating perennials through hybridization. TLI researchers are crossing annual wheat with several perennial cousins, including _T. intermedium_, and they are crossing annual sorghum with _Sorghum halepense_ (Johnson grass).

**166** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

There is also strong interest in polycultures at TLI, which can be designed to fix N, reduce the spread of insect and disease outbreaks, and use soil and light resources more efficiently (and thus reduce or eliminate weeds) (Figure 14.3).

Even if the breeding programs are successful, widespread use of the new crops would depend on changes in the ways farmers and consumers think. Consumers will need to be open about the possibility of cream of Kernza on the breakfast table, and grain farms will have to be redesigned to exploit the advantages of permanent cover.

Perennial grains, once they are developed, would likely be grown in relatively diverse agroecosystems very different from fields of monocropped annuals. These systems would more closely resemble natural prairies and provide many of the “environmental services” provided by prairies. Two huge examples are nitrogen retention (see Culman et al. 2013) and carbon sequestration. Loss of carbon and nitrogen are almost defining characteristics of the highly disturbed early successional ecosystem that we create to produce most of our food. Developing agroecosystems that function in a slightly later stage of succession (see Chapter 18) could dramatically improve carbon accumulation and the efficiency of soil resource use. It is not yet known how close a perennial agriculture can come to the original soil organic matter equilibrium of the prairie, but the reduced disturbance and greater belowground C inputs move the soil in the right direction.

In the foregoing paragraphs, _r_ - and _K_ -selection theory has been discussed in the context of crop plants and their herbivorous pests, but it also has relevance for livestock animals. As a general rule, what have proved most valuable to humans in livestock are _K_ -selected traits, and this is reflected both in the animal species humans chose to domesticate and the traits selected for in the domestication process. The _K_ -selected trait of large size was of obvious value to humans seeking both a food supply and animals that could do work and transport goods. In the case of cattle, goats, and sheep, the _K-_ selected trait of milk production (a clear example of parental investment) was also valuable. Once species such as horses, oxen, cattle, sheep, goats, and hogs were domesticated, their _K_ -selected characters became the basis for further human-directed selection in the “K” direction (e.g., large size and more milk production). This was not so much the case with avian livestock, such as chickens, where higher offspring numbers, more rapid growth rates, and greater mobility indicate some _r_ -selected traits. However, even in poultry, human breeding has often introduced characteristics of _K_ -selection, such as greatly increased body size. In nature, this might be considered to be a negative adaptive trait, but in an agroecosystem context, humans can step in to compensate for such disadvantages.

Population Ecology of Agroecosystems **167**

An interesting proposal is to combine the strengths and advantages of both strategies in a single crop population. The fast-growing, opportunistic, high reproductive effort of the _r_ -strategist might be combined with the resistance, biomass accumulation, and stress tolerance of the _K_ -strategist. An example of such an effort—the attempt to develop a perennial grain crop—is discussed in Developing a Perennial Grain Crop. In later chapters, when the ecosystem concepts of diversity and succession are presented, additional attention will be given to the use of _K_ -strategists in agroecosystems.

**Stress/Disturbance-Intensity Theory** As an alternative to the _r_ - and _K_ -selection theory, ecologists have developed a life history classification system for plants with three categories instead of two. It is based on the premise that there are two basic factors—stress and disturbance—that

limit the amount of biomass a plant can produce in a given environment. Stress occurs through external conditions that limit production, such as shading, drought, nutrient deficiency, or low temperature. Disturbance occurs when there is partial or total disruption of plant biomass due to natural events such as grazing or fire or to human activities such as mowing or tillage. When habitats are described using both dimensions—as either high stress or low stress and either low disturbance or high disturbance—four types of habitats are defined. Each of these habitats is then associated with a particular life history strategy, as shown in Table 14.1. This scheme may have more direct application to agricultural environments than the _r_ - and _K_ -selection theory, and may be of particular use in weed management.

Since an environment characterized by both high stress and high disturbance cannot support much plant growth, there are three useful classifications in this system:

1. **Ruderals** (R), which are adapted to conditions of

high disturbance and low stress; 2. **Stress tolerators** (R), which live in high-stress,

low-disturbance environments; 3. **Competitors** (C), which live under conditions of

low stress and low disturbance and have good competitive abilities.

Most annual cropping systems present conditions of high disturbance because of frequent cultivation and harvest, but have relatively low stress since conditions have been optimized through agricultural inputs and crop system

**TABLE 14.1**

design. Ruderals are highly favored under these conditions, where the characteristics of short life span, high seed production, and ability to colonize open environments have such advantage. Most plants that fall into the ruderal category—annual weeds, for example—can also be categorized as _r_ -selected.

Degraded agroecosystems, such as eroded hillsides in wet environments, or heavily cropped grain systems in dryfarmed areas that suffer periodic drought stress and wind erosion, favor the growth of stress tolerators. Noncrop species that are tolerant of these conditions may become the dominant feature of the landscape; examples are _Imperata_ grasses in the wet tropics of Southeast Asia and cheatgrass ( _Bromus tectorum_ ) in the Great Basin rangelands of the Western United States. Since stress tolerators have been

selected to endure the environmental stress characteristic of

highly degraded and altered environments, they can establish and maintain dominance even though the environment in which they occur is relatively unproductive.

Many natural ecosystems, as well as perennial cropping systems, support the competitor category of plants. These plants have developed characteristics that maximize the capture of resources under relatively undisturbed conditions, but are not tolerant of heavy biomass removal. Excessive disturbance through harvest would open the system up to the invasion of weedy ruderals, whereas increased intensity of stress, such as that which would accompany overextraction of soil nutrients or water, would open the system to invasion from stress-tolerating organisms. When a forest system made up primarily of competitor species is clear-cut and the soil ecosystem is left intact, recolonization by stress-tolerant early successional species is an initial problem, but tree species can usually reestablish and eventually recolonize the site and exclude them. But if fire periodically removes vegetative cover following tree harvest, the intensity of disturbance opens the system to invasion and dominance by shorter-lived and aggressive ruderals that greatly retard the recovery of the forest species.

Both _r_ - and _K_ -selection theory and stress/disturbanceintensity theory provide opportunities for combining our understanding of the environment with our understanding of the population dynamics of the organisms we are dealing with. By focusing this knowledge on both crop and noncrop species, we can plan our agricultural activities accordingly.

**ECOLOGICAL NICHE**

The concept of life history strategy helps us understand how a population maintains a place in an ecosystem over time. An additional conceptual framework is required for understanding what that place is and what the species’ ecological specialization might be. This is the concept of **ecological niche** .

An organism’s ecological niche is defined in terms of both its place and its function in the environment. Niche comprises the organism’s physical location in the environment, its trophic role, its limits and tolerances for environmental

**168** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

conditions, and its relationship to other organisms. The concept of ecological niche establishes an important foundation for determining the potential impact that a population can have on an environment and the other organisms that are there. It can be of great value in managing the complex interactions between populations in an agroecosystem.

**C** **onceptualizations** **of** **N** **iche**

The niche concept was first introduced in the pioneering work of Grinnell (1924, 1928) and Elton (1927) as the place of an animal in the environment. By “place”, they meant a species’ maximum possible distribution, controlled only by its structural limits and instincts. Today, this aspect of niche is part of what is termed fundamental or **potential** **niche** . Potential niche is contrasted with **realized niche**, the actual area that a species is able to occupy, as determined by its interactions with other organisms in the environment (i.e., by the impacts of interference, positive and negative).

Both potential niche and realized niche are built on a conceptualization of niche that has two distinct facets. The “Grinnellian” focus is on the conditions of the habitat in

which the organism occurs; the “Eltonian” focus is on what the organism does in that habitat—its ecological role. The latter facet can be understood as the organism’s “profession,” the way it “makes a living” in the habitat it lives in. An animal’s profession, for example, can be flower feeder, leaf feeder, or insect feeder. A microorganism can be a decomposer or a parasite. Many levels of interaction are involved in defining this ecological specialization aspect of a species’ niche.

An important contribution to the niche concept was made by Gause (1934), who developed a theory now known as Gause’s law: two organisms cannot occupy the same ecological niche at the same time. If the niches of two organisms in the same habitat are too similar, and there are limited resources, one organism eventually excludes the other through “competitive exclusion.” Competitive exclusion, however, is not always the cause of two populations with similar niches not occurring together. Other mechanisms may be at work.

The idea of the niche being an organism’s profession is often not adequate. To develop a more complex way of understanding niche, ecologists have focused on defining the separate dimensions that make it up. A set of factor– response curves (discussed in Chapter 3) is determined for a particular organism. These are then layered over each other to form a matrix of factor responses. In a simple two-factor matrix, the area delineated by the overlapping regions of tolerance can be envisioned as the 2D area of resource space occupied by the organism. With the addition of more factor–response curves, this space takes on multidimensional form. This procedure is the basis for a conceptualization of niche as the “multidimensional hypervolume” that an organism can potentially occupy (Hutchinson 1957). By including biotic interactions in the factor matrix, the hypervolume formed by overlapping

factor–response curves comes close to defining the actual niche that an organism occupies.

**N** **iche** **A** **mplitude**

When the niche is thought of as a multidimensional space, it becomes apparent that the size and shape of this space is different for each species. A measurement of one or more of its dimensions is termed **niche breadth** or **niche amplitude** (Levins 1968; Colwell and Futuyma 1971; Devictor et al. 2010), or niche width (Odum and Barrett 2005). Organisms with a narrow niche and very specialized habitat adaptations and activities are called specialists. Those that have a broader niche are referred to as generalists. Generalists are more adaptable than specialists, can adjust more readily to change in the environment, and use a range of resources. Specialists are much more specific in their distribution and activities, but have the advantage of being able to make better use of an abundant resource when it is available. In some cases, since a generalist is not that thorough in its use of resources in a habitat, it leaves niche space within its niche for specialists. In other words, there can be several specialist niches inside of a generalist niche.

**E** **cological** **S** **pecialization** **and** **N** **iche** **D** **iversity**

Natural ecosystems are often characterized by a high degree of species diversity. In such systems, many different species occupy what appear at first glance to be similar ecological niches. If we accept Gause’s law—that two species cannot occupy the same niche at the same time without one excluding the other—then we must conclude that the niches of the similar organisms are in fact distinct in some way, or that some mechanism must be allowing coexistence to occur. Competitive exclusion appears to be a relatively uncommon phenomenon.

In cropping systems as well, ecologically similar organisms occupy simultaneously what appears to be the same niche. In fact, farmers have learned from accumulated experience and constant observation of their fields that there can often be advantages to managing a mixture of crop and noncrop organisms in a cropping system even when many of the constituents of the mixture have similar requirements. Competitive exclusion rarely occurs; therefore there must be some level of coexistence or avoidance of competition.

This coexistence of outwardly similar organisms in both natural ecosystems and agroecosystems is made possible by some kind of ecological divergence between the species involved. This divergence is referred to as **niche diversity** or diversification of the niche. Some examples include the following:

- Plants with different rooting depths. Variable crop

architecture belowground permits different species to avoid direct interference for nutrients or water

while occupying very similar components of the niche aboveground (Figure 14.4).

Population Ecology of Agroecosystems **169**

It appears that natural selection acts to create niche differentiation by separating some portion of the niche of one population from that of another. Ecological specialization and niche differentiation allow partial overlap of niches to occur without exclusion.

The concept of niche, combined with knowledge of the niches of crop and noncrop species, can provide an important tool for agroecosystem management. A farmer can take advantage of niche diversity to exclude a species that is a detriment to the agroecosystem; similarly, he or she can use niche differentiation to allow a combination of species that is of benefit to the system (Figure 14.4).

**APPLICATIONS OF NICHE**

**THEORY TO AGRICULTURE**

**FIGURE 14.4** **Different root architectures permitting niche** **overlap.** The shallow root system of the transplanted broccoli (left) and the deeper tap root system of the direct-seeded wild mustard (right) take resources from different parts of the soil profile, allowing the plants to occupy the same habitat without negative interference.

- Plants with different photosynthetic pathways.

When one crop uses the C4 pathway for photosynthesis and another uses C3, the first may thrive in full sunlight while the other tolerates the reducedlight environment created by the shade of the emergent species. The traditional corn/bean intercrop common in Mesoamerica is a well-known example.

- Insects with different prey preference. Two similar

parasitic insects may co-occur in a cropping system, but they parasitize different hosts. Host–parasite specificity may be one way of diversifying the niche so as to allow for coexistence of adult insects else where in the cropping system.

- Birds with different hunting or nesting behaviors.

Several predatory birds may all feed on similar prey in an agroecosystem, but since they have different nesting habits and sites, or feed at different times of day, they can co-occur in the cropping system and help control pest organisms. Owls and hawks are a good example.

- Plants with different nutritional needs. Mixed pop ulations of weeds can co-occur in the same habitat

due in part to the differential nutritional needs that may have evolved over time in each species as a result of the selective advantage of avoiding competitive exclusion. A crop population may suffer less negative interference from a mixed population of weeds than from a population of a single dominant weed with niche characteristics similar to that

of the crop.

Farmers are constantly managing aspects of the ecological niches of the organisms that occupy the farming system, even though most never refer directly to the concept. Once it is understood as a useful tool of ecosystem management, however, it can be applied in a variety of ways, from ensuring maximum yield through an understanding of a main crop’s niche to determining whether a noncrop species is likely to cause negative interference with the crop. Some specific examples follow.

**P** **romoting** **or** **I** **nhibiting** **E** **stablishment**

**of** **W** **eedy** **S** **pecies**

Any part of the soil surface not occupied by the crop population is subject to invasion by weedy noncrop species. Specialized for being successful in what can be termed productive environments (i.e., farm fields), weeds occupy a niche that favors _r_ -selected or ruderal populations of annual herbs. In cropping systems with less disturbance, where total plant biomass undergoes less disruption or removal, competitive (but still _r_ -selected) biennial or perennial weeds become common. In a sense, weediness is a relatively specialized niche characteristic.

The habitat facet of the niche concept can be used to help guide how the environmental conditions of a farm field are manipulated in order to promote or inhibit the establishment of weedy species. The type of modification will depend on the niche specificity of each species in relation to the crop. With knowledge of the niche characteristics of a weed species, we can begin by controlling the conditions of the “safe sites” to the disadvantage of the weed. Additionally, we can look for some critical or susceptible phase in the life cycle of the weed population in which a particular management practice could eliminate or reduce the population. It may also be possible to promote the growth of a weed population that will inhibit other weeds. For example, wild mustard ( _Brassica_ spp.) has little negative effect on crop plants but has the ability to displace, through interference, other weeds that may have a negative influence on the crop. A more detailed discussion of this phenomenon is provided in the case study _Broccoli and Lettuce Intercrop_ .

**170** Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems

It is important to remember that most weeds are colonizers and invaders and that crop fields that are disturbed annually are just the type of habitats they have been selected for. The challenge is to find a way to incorporate these ecological concepts into a management plan where planned activities, such as cultivation, are timed or controlled so that the weedy niche may be occupied by more desirable species.

**B** **iological** **C** **ontrol** **of** **I** **nsect** **P** **ests**

Classical **biological control** is an excellent example of the use of the niche concept. A beneficial organism is introduced into an agroecosystem for the purpose of having it occupy an empty niche. Most commonly, a predatory or parasitic species is brought into a crop system from which it was absent in order to put negative pressure on the population of a particular prey or host that has been able to reach pest or disease levels due to the absence of the beneficial organism.

It is hoped that once the beneficial organism is introduced into the cropping system it will be able to complete its entire life cycle and reproduce in large enough numbers to become a permanent resident of the agroecosystem. But often the conditions of the niche into which the beneficial species is introduced may not meet its requirements for long-term survival

and reproduction, so reintroductions become necessary. This can be especially true in a constantly changing agricultural environment with high disturbance and regular alteration of the characteristics of the niche needed to maintain permanent populations of both the pest and the beneficial. Mitigating this problem is one of the advantages of maintaining high diversity at the landscape level (see Chapter 23).

Another potential use of the niche in biological control is the introduction of another organism that has a niche very similar to that of the pest, but which has a less negative impact on the crop. The introduced herbivore, for example, may feed on a part of the plant that is not of economic significance. If the introduced herbivore has a niche similar enough to the target pest, it might be able to displace it. There might be similar applications for weeds.

When two or more different crop populations are planted together to form an intercropped agroecosystem, and the resulting yields of the combined populations are greater than those of the crops planted separately, it is very likely that the yield increases are a result of complementarity of the niche characteristics of the member populations. For intercropping

**CASE STUDY: BROCCOLI AND LETTUCE INTERCROP**

An intercrop is successful when the potential competitive interferences between its component crop species are minimized. This is accomplished by mixing plants with complementary patterns of resource use or complementary life history strategies.

Two crops that have been shown to combine well in an intercrop are broccoli and lettuce. Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz farm facility (Aoki et al. 1989) have demonstrated that a mixture of these crops will produce a higher yield than a monoculture of lettuce and a monoculture of broccoli grown on the same area of land. (This result, called overyielding, is explained in greater detail in Chapter 17.)

In the study, broccoli and lettuce were planted together at three different densities and the yields from each compared to yields from monocrops of each crop. The lowest intercrop density was a substitution intercrop, in which the overall planting density was similar to that of a standard monocrop. The highest density intercrop was an addition intercrop, in which broccoli plants were added between lettuce plants planted at a standard density. The monocrops were planted at standard commercial densities, which are designed to avoid intraspecific competition.

All three densities of intercrop produced higher total yields than the monocultures. The yield advantages ranged from a 10% greater yield to a 36% greater yield (for the substitution intercrop). The addition intercrop produced lettuce heads of a slightly lower mean weight than the monoculture lettuce, but the combined production still exceeded the total that was produced by a combination of monocrops on the same amount of land. The intercrops also retained more soil moisture than the monocrops, indicating that the physical arrangement of the two species in the field helps to conserve this resource.

These results indicate that interspecific competitive interference did not negatively impact the plants in the intercrops, even when their density was approximately twice that of either of the monocrops. For this avoidance of competition to have occurred, the broccoli and lettuce must each have been able to utilize resources that were not accessible to the other species.

An examination of the two species’ life histories and niches illuminates the complementarity of their resource use patterns and suggests mechanisms for the observed overyielding. Lettuce matures rapidly, completing nearly all of its growth within 45 days of being transplanted into the field. It also has a relatively shallow root system. Broccoli matures much more slowly and its roots penetrate much deeper into the soil. Therefore, when the two are planted nearly simultaneously, lettuce receives all the resources it needs to complete its growth well before the broccoli grows very large; then after the lettuce is harvested, the broccoli can take full advantage of the available resources as it grows to maturity.

Population Ecology of Agroecosystems **171**

systems to be successful, each species must have a somewhat different niche. Therefore, full knowledge of the niche characteristics of each species is essential. In some intercrop cases, each species occupies a completely unrelated or otherwise unoccupied niche in the system, leading to niche complementarity. In most cases, however, the niches of the member species overlap, but interference at the interspecific level is less intense than interference at the intraspecific level.

Successful management of crop mixtures, then, depends on knowing each member’s population dynamics, as well as its specific niche characteristics. Such knowledge then forms the basis for management of the intercrop as a community of populations, a level of agroecological management on which we will focus in Chapter 16.

**POPULATION ECOLOGY: A CROP PERSPECTIVE**

In this chapter, the focus has been on populations in the context of their environment. Important similarities and differences between populations of crop, noncrop, and natural species have been discussed. Some of these characteristics, along with additional relevant ones, are summarized in Table 14.2.

Knowledge of these characteristics becomes especially important when we are trying to find ecologically based management strategies for weedy noncrop species. Weedy species have maintained some of the characteristics of wild, natural ecosystem populations (e.g., dispersability, strong intra- and interspecific interference ability, dormancy), but through a range of adaptations (e.g., high seed viability, even-aged population structure, high reproduction allocation, narrower genetic diversity) have adapted to the conditions of disturbance and alteration of the environment

common in agroecosystems, especially those systems that

depend on annual crops. The ability of weeds to thrive in agroecosystems poses strong challenges for the agroecosys tem manager.

Each species has certain strategies for ensuring that individuals of that species successfully complete their life cycles, thus enabling populations of that species to maintain a presence in a certain habitat over time. Principles of population ecology, applied agroecologically, help the farmer decide where and how to take advantage of each species’ particular life history strategy to either promote or limit the population growth of the species, depending on its role in the agroecosystem. Agroecosystem managers and researchers need to build on population ecology concepts such as safe site, _r_ - and _K_ -strategies, and ecological niche to further develop techniques and principles for effective and sustainable management of crop and noncrop organisms.
