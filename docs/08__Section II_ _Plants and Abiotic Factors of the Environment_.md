## _Section II_ _Plants and Abiotic Factors of the Environment_

In the absence of photosynthesis, life on earth would probably consist of little more than colonies of one-celled chemotrophic bacteria. On land, the preeminent practitioners of photosynthesis are the higher (i.e., vascular) plants. As the producers upon which nearly all other life forms depend, vascular plants form the foundation of virtually all terrestrial ecosystems—and all the agroecosystems from which humans derive most of their food.

Although even the simplest of agroecosystems involve complex relationships among crop plants, noncrop plants, animals, and soil microorganisms and between each of these types of organisms and the physical environment, the most basic of relationships are those between individual photosynthesizing crop plants and their environment. Temperature, rainfall, exposure to sunlight, soil fertility, and other physical aspects of the environment are the central determinants of photosynthetic rate and plant growth—and thus production of edible biomass. Before attempting to understand agroecosystems at their full level of complexity, therefore, it is helpful to make a focused study of how individual crop plants respond to the conditions they encounter in the environment.

This ecological approach, known as _physiological ecology_ or _autecology_, provides a necessary starting point for our study of whole agroecosystems.

Autecological study of the plants that make up agroecosystems begins by breaking down the environment into individual _factors_ and exploring how each factor affects the crop plant. Consistent with this approach, the core chapters in this section are each devoted to a single environmental factor of importance in agroecosystems. Each chapter describes how its factor functions in time and space and then gives examples of how farmers have learned either to accommodate their crops to this factor or to take advantage of it to improve the sustainability of the agroecosystem. These chapters are preceded by a chapter that reviews the basic structure and function of the plant itself, providing a basis for understanding its responses.

The interactions examined in these chapters are the foundation of the ecological thinking that is elaborated on in subsequent sections and that becomes the basis for understanding the interactions and relationships among the diverse social, political, economic, and ecological components of the food system.
